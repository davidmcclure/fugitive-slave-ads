Transcript: RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 20th of March last, before leaving Providence Settlement for Mississippi, a negro boy named TOM, about 5 ft. 8 or 10 in. high, yellow complected, very high forehead, and bare to the middle of his head, down look when spoken to, and very white eyes. He left me to visit his wife and has not been seen since, but it is supposed he is harbored between Waxhaw and Sugar Creeks, as he has relations on both. A reward of Twenty Dollars will be given for his delivery, either to J. B. Peoples or N. M. Stitt, of Mecklenburg county, or Fifty Dollars if delivered to myself in Panola county, Mississippi. <br></br>J. E. Stitt.<br></br>June 28, 1848.                  38tf
