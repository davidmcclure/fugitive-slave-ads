Transcript: RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 11th instant, a negro girl by the name of RACHEL, about 20 years old yellow complected, grum look, bushy head and belongs to Miss E. Lowry. She left without sause. As I have not heard of her since she aloped, I suspect she is harbored by some one. I will therefore pay the above reward for her apprehension alone. It is not necessary to describe her clothing as she would certainly change them.<br></br>T.J. HOLTON<br></br>July 17, 1850.
