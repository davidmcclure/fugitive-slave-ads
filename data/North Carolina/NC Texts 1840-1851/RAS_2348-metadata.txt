Transcript: REWARD<br></br>For the apprehension of a White Man and<br></br>A NEGRO WOMAN<br></br>RANAWAY on Saturday night last, a white man living near Ringgold, in Pittslvannia county, Va., named JOHN GUNNEL, an overseer for the undersignedâ€”who bundled up his clothes about the rising of the moon, and giving his wife to understand that she would never see him again he decamped for parts unknown, taking with him, it is believed, a mulatto woman belonging to the subscriber, who packed up her clothes and left about the same time. From all the circumstances in the case, there is no doubt but that Gunnel has persuaded this woman off with himl and he may be taking her to a free State, or he may have gone to Knoxville Tenn., where he has an Uncle residing.<br></br>GUNNEL is about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high; dark complexion; well made; is about 50 years of age, with dark hair mixed with grey, wore whiskers, interspersed with grey hairs, and had an old broad brim white hat. Said Gunnel has inhumanly deserted his wife and children; tbus[sic] proving himself a scamp of the deepest dye.<br></br>MARTHA, (the girl,) is about 16 or 17 years of age; of good form; tolerably tall; has a scar on one side of her face; is a copper colored mulatto; quick spoken; and took with her a variety of clothing.<br></br>The above reward of $100 will be paid for the arrest of Gunnel and the girl Martha, (should they be found together,) and their confinement in any jail so that I get them in my possossion[sic]. Or, I will pay $25 for the arrest of the girl if caught within 25 miles of Ringgold and delivered to me: If apprehended beyond this distance, I will give $50 for her delivery to me or #30 for her confinement in jail so that I get her again.<br></br>TIMOTHY H. STAMPS.<br></br>Kinggold[sic] P. Office, June 3rd, 1850.
