Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>I WILL give a reward of $20 for the apprehension and delivery of my negro man Dave, or for his confinement in any jail so that I get him again. Dave absconded from my plantation, in the upper end of Richmond county, on the 22d inst. His complexion is black, wears a bushy head of hair, is about 30 years old, five feet 10 or 11 inches high, had on when he left a full suit of Kersey cloth, and took with him a pretty good suit of Sunday clothes besides. It is suspected that he will try to go off as far as he can. All persons are hereby cautioned by the penalty of the law against harbouring or concealing said negro.<BR>DANIEL McRAE.<BR>November 30, 1840.<BR>26-6w
