Transcript: ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>The undersigned will give the above reward for the apprehension of his negro fellow WILSON.<BR>Wilson ranaway from my service about the 30th day of August last. From authentic information, which I have lately received, there is no doubt but he is now lurking in the neighborhood, with a debased white woman, or with an unprincipled white man, disguised in female apparel; that he is armed with a gun, and probably with other dangerous and unlawful weapons; and that he has it in contemplation to make his way immediately to some free Stae.  The undersigned will pay the above reward for the apprehension of the negro Wilson, until the stoppage of this advertisement.  It is to be hoped that all true friends to the safety of society and to the preservation of discipline and order among our slave population, will strenuously excite themselve to apprehend this runaway.<BR>Description.--Wilson is about six feet two inches in height--is stoutly made, and weighs from 185 to 190 pounds--has an abrupt manner when met by any person. He is of a dark complexion, has a scar upon the left temple near the ear, which was produced by a burn; and without being round shouldered, he bends forward considerably when walking; his feet are unusually large and his toes turn out when walking.<BR>J.Q.A LEACH.<BR>Johnston County, Aug. 7, 1810    303 11
