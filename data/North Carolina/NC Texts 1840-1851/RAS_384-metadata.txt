Jacob robbed the overseer's trunk of some articles of clothing. and run off on the 24th inst., and will make his way to Edgecombe, where he was raised by a man by the name of Cherry. He has lived in Tarborough and Conetoe, and I believe a man by the name of Dicken owns his mother, who lives in the neighborhood of Doct. Powell's. Jacob is a small black fellow, with a round face and down look; his clothing was a homespun frock coat and pantaloons, both of a grayish color, and wore a cloth cap speckled--has travelled with me for several years.<BR>PETER EVANS.<BR>Egypt, July 26th, 1840.<BR>32 4
