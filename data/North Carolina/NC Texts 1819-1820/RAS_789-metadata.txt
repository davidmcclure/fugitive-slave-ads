Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY some time in the month of June last, two Negroes named JACOB and JUDY, (man and wife.) The fellow is a bright mulatto, and calls himself John Bell: his wife is quite black and has also changed her name. They are supposed to be lurking about Edenton, or in Pasquotank county, where the woman originally came from.--Jacob is about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, about 35 years of age, has a pleasing address, and one, if not both of his eye teeth projecting a little out from the other, and the inside of ancles[sic] unusually full or rounding. Judy is about 36 or 37 years of age, tall and slender made, and is no doubt in company with her husband, who is a pretty good boot and shoemaker. They can both read, and perhaps write a little; and have with them a free pass, which, I understand, will impose upon most people from the plausible manner in which it is made out. They ran away from Mr. Ezekiel Staten, of Edgecombe county.--The above reward will be given for delivering them to me in Pitt county, near the town of Washington, or securing them in gaol so that I get them, or 30 Dollars for Jacob.<BR>James Langley.<BR>January 22, 1820.    3w699
