Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber on the 26th of March last, a negro man named JIM, about forty years of age, near six feet high, light complexion, bow-leged [legged], and very likely, had somewhat of an impediment in his speech, and is a very good shoemaker.  Jim had no cause for going off except for striking his overseer, for which he expected correction.  The above will be given by me for the delivery of said Jim, if caught in Orange county, or forty if taken without the county and delivered to me. <BR>Wm.[William] Cain, Sen. <BR>Hillsborough, May 16, 1820  15--7t
