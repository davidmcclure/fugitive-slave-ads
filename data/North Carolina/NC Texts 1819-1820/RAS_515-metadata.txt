Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, a likely Negro Fellow, named NED.<BR>He is about 5 feet 8 inches high, 35 or 37 years of age, has a remarkable short nose, and quite stout. I expect he is lurking about the residence of Benjamin Harvey in Pasquotank, as he has connexions there.  I will give the above reward for delivering him to me, or confining him in any jail so that I get him again. Masters of vessels and others are forbid harboring, employing, or carrying him off, at their peril.<BR>Richard H. Blount.<BR>Chowan, Dec. 6, 1819.    tf694
