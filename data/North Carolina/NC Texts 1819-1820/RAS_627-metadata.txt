Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on the fourth of this instant, a Negro man named SAM, about twenty-two years of age, five feet, nine or ten inches high, black complection, straight and spare made- a weakness in his left eye, which occasions him to keep it nearly shut, a scar on his forehead, over his right eye as well as I remember, and has a very large navel. He took sundry cloathing with him, amongst which, was a homespun mixed coat, a pair or blue cloth pantaloons, a pair of half boots, and a new black fur hat-- He may attempt to pass for a free man, as he is well acquainted through the country, in different directions, having followed waggoning a number of years: especially on the road to Petersburg and Fayetteville. I will pay the above reward to any person that will deliver said negro to me in Wake County, near the Fishdam Ford, on Neuse River, or confine him in any Jail in this or any other State, so that I get him again, and reasonable expenses paid.<BR>BLUNT COOPER.<BR>Wake County, N.C. Nov. 9 1819 52tf
