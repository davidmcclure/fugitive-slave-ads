Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 29th August, a negro man named NERO, 22 years of age, 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high; has a slight scar on his instep, done while cutting wood; full eyes, the whites of a yellowish cast; slim made, but fleshy. He carried away several suits of clothes, a rug and blanket. Nero can read, and is a plausible, dressy, swaggering, impudent fellow. He will endeavor to go off in a vessel from Wilmington or Newbern, or by land to the northern states, as he has attempted it by land before. If he should not get a free pass, he will tell some story to avoid detection.<BR>I will give the above reward to lodge him in any Jail, so that I get him; and pay all reasonable expences for his delivery to me, or the Jailor in Wilmington. I will also give ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS upon conviction of any man attempting to carry him out of the State.<BR>HENRY YOUNG.<BR>Brunswick County,}<BR>Sept 5, 1820} 96tf
