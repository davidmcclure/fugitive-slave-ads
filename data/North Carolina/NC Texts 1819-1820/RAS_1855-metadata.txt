Transcript: Ten Dollars reward. <BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on the 10th of July last, a negro man named SAM, twenty-four or twenty-five years old, near six feet high, stout made, of a black complection[sic], and very likely.  It is supposed he is lurking in the neighbourhood of Alexander Borland, near Hillsborough, as he has a wife there; or probably he may undertake to procure a free pass.  The above reward will be given to any person who may apprehend said negro and deliver him to me, or confine him in jail so that I get him again if taken in this county or twenty dollars if taken out of the county. <BR>Lewis Hutchins. <BR>Orange county, N.C.
