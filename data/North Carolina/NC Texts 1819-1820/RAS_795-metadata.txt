Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward<BR>RUNAWAY from Simon Turner's Esq.[Esquire] of this county, on Monday evening the 15 ult. a Negro Man, named<BR>SILAS.<BR>He is about 20 or 25 years of age, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, quite black, fond of spirituous liquors, and is apt to get drunk, rather a down look when spoken to: his clothing I knew very little of; nor am I acquainted with any marks he may have about him, as I very recently purchased him of William Norfleet, of Northampton county. He has a wife in or near Windsor, and is probably lurking in the neighborhood of that place, or gone to Edenton. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver said fellow to me, or secure him in any jail so that I can get him again.--All persons are forwarned from harboring, employing, or carrying him off at their peril.<BR>William Britton.<BR>Britton's Store, Bertie county, Dec 4, 1819.   tf695
