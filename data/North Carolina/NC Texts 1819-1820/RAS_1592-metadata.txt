Transcript: RANAWAY From the subscriber, on the 28th of August last, his negro man TOM, about twenty-six years of age, of a dark yellow complexion, about 5 feet eleven inches in height, square built. He is branded on both cheeks: with the letter H on the right, and C on the left. His upper fore teeth considerably rotton[sic]--he speaks plain, though he has a little impedement[sic] in his speech--and is apt to smile when spoken to. The brands on his face are not such without a close examination. It is thought that he has procured a free pass, and will attempt to pass as a free man, having once before attempted it. I will give twenty-five dollars for his delivery to me in Wayne county, near Waynesborough, and all reasonable expenses paid, or twenty dollars if confined in any Jail so that I get him again.<BR>HOPTON COOR.<BR>Waynesborough, Sept. 3, 1820.<BR>33 6t.
