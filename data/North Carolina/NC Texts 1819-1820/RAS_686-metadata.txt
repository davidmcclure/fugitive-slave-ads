Transcript: Twenty Dollars reward<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, near Salisbury, Rowan county, a black man slave, by the name of Kit, about twenty-three years old, five feet nine inches high, straight and well built, has a down look. It is supposed that he can write his own pass. He has a rifle gun, and shot pouch, one woolen coat, two pair of pantaloons flax and toe. John Smith purchased said negro from Henry Lea, Sampson County, North-Carolina. Kit is a sensible polite fellow; and I think it is likely he will aim for Sampson county, in the state of North-Carolina. I will pay the above reward to any person who will secure him in any jail so that I get him, or deliver him to me, or ten dollars in the county, for him, rifle gun, and all reasonable expences paid.<BR>DAVID SMITH.<BR>Rowan county, N.C. March 20, 1820.<BR>13-2m
