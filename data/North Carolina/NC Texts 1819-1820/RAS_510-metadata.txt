Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, on Saturday morning last, two and a half miles from Fayetteville, on the Camden Road, a negro man named DAVE; he is very stout, well made, dark complected, about five feet eight or ten inches high.  He has been shot in one of his legs and the scars are very perceptible on the calf of it.  He had on when he absconded a light mixed homespun short coat and pantaloons, and a red flannel shirt.  He took several other articles of clothing with him, so that it is likely he may change his dress.  The above reward of twenty-five dollars will be given to any person who will deliver him to me whilst I stay in Fayetteville or secure him in any jail in the state, so that I get him again.  Masters of vessels, and other persons are forwarned from harboring, employing or carrying said slave out of the state, as the law will be enforced against any such offender or offenders.<BR>Jas. [James] G Tignor.<BR>Fayetteville, Feb'y.[February] 8, 1819.--19tf
