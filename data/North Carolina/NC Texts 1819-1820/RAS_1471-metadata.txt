Transcript: 100 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber on Sunday night, the 2d instant, Negro Man<BR>Ben, and his wife Celia.<BR>Ben is 23 or 24 years old rather under the common size and very black. Celia is about the same age and height of Ben; is a bright mulatto, slim made, and has a pleasing countenance. They will, no doubt, attempt to return to Mr. Ephraim Elliott's neighborhood, in the upper end of Chowan county, from whom they were purchased, and to whom the mother of Celia belongs, or may visit the lower end of Gates county, where they are well known. The above reward will be given for taking up the said Negroes, and lodging them in any gaol so that I get them, or 50 dollars for either, and all reasonable expences, if brought home to me at Salmon-Creek, Bertie county.<BR>Stark Armistead.<BR>May 3d, 1819.
