Transcript: RUNAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber, on Monday the 1st instant, a likely young Negro Fellow named<BR>HARRY.<BR>He is about 18 years of age, yellow complexion, smiling countenance, about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high, rather inclined to be stout. The same evening, a small bay horse was taken out of a neighbor's stable; which it is believed, was the act of Harry, as the horse has not since been heard of. It is supposed he has made for Pasquotank, where he probably expects aid and succor from the free blacks of that county. --I will give 25 Dollars reward if taken up without this county, or 10 Dollars if within, provided he is brought home to me, or secured so that I get him again.<BR>Richard H. Blount.<BR>Bluff-Point, Chowan, May 9, 1820.
