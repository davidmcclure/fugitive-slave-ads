Transcript: Stop the Runaway.<BR>ABSCONDED from the subscriber in August last, a Negro man named CAESAR, 45 or 46 years of age, has a lofty carriage, and lisps in his speech, particularly when angry or frightened, his left shoulder lower apparently than his right, his feet slender in proportion to their length, the large toes of his feet have been injured by cold, but perhaps not perceivable at this time.  He was purchased by Archibald M'Fadyen of Stephen W. Winn, near Newbern, in whose neighborhood he is probably now lurking.  I will give 20 Dollars for delivering of him to me at my residence, or to Neill Graham of Fayetteville, and 10 Dollars for securing him in any jail in this state so that I get him again.<BR>DANIEL M'FADDIEN.<BR>October 28.    88 3w
