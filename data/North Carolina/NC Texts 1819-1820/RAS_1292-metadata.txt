Transcript: Ten Dollars reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 31st January last, a negro boy by the name of TOM, about fifteen years old. Tom is a very black boy and has a small scar over one of his eyes, near the eye-brow, occasioned by a cut, and had on when he went away, dark yarn homespun clothes. Tom was taken up on Thursday last, at Chapel-Hill, by Captain Nimrod Ragsdale, and made his escape from him. Capt. Ragsdale informs me that Tom attempted to pass for a free boy, and had hired himself at Chapel-Hill to cut wood at the College. I will give the above reward, if delivered to me nine miles west of Raleigh, or five dollars if lodged in any jail, so that I get him again.<BR>Tom may probably attempt to change his name, or disown his master's name.<BR>J. M. JELKS.<BR>Feb. 8, 1820.<BR>6-2tp.
