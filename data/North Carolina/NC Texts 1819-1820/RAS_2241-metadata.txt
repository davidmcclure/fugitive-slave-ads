Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward,<BR>WILL be paid to any person that will take up and confine in any jail in this State, a negro man named ARON who ranaway from me about six weeks ago. He is of a very black complexion, rather small in size, of a still quiet turn, by trade a Waggon and Stage-Maker, & is handy at any thing he goes about.  I have heard of his being in Raleigh since he ranaway, and may probably keep to Warrenton, where he lived before I bought him.<BR>JAMES BIGGS.<BR>Fayetteville, July 14, 1819.
