Transcript: Fifty dollars Reward.<BR>RUN AWAY from the subscriber on the 3d day of September last, a Negro man named <BR>ISAAC;<BR>rather light complexion; about five feet ten or eleven inches high, stout built; and about 40 years of age, by trade a Blacksmith, who absented himself from my service without any cause; consequently I expect it is his intention to leave this State for the northward. As he formerly belonged to John Alderson of Washington, and has connexions[sic] there, I think it likely he may be yet lurking in that neighborhood. The above reward will be given to any person who will apprehend said negro and lodge him in any Jail in the State, so that I get him again.<BR>All masters of Vessels and other persons, are hereby forwarned harboring, employing, or carrying away such negro, as the rigour of the law will be enforced against them.<BR>LOVETT BELL.<BR>Hyde County. May 14, 1819--6w207
