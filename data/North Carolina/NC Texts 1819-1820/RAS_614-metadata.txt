Transcript: Two Runaways.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber about two months ago, two negro fellows--one by the name of ALLEN, about thirty years of age, of a common size, and has a grum look. The other by the name of SIMON, about twenty five years of age, stout built, and active. He was once shot in Franklin county, and now bears marks of the shot in one of his arms and on his body.--I will give twenty dollars reward for Allen, delivered to me in Wake, or a reasonable reward for his apprehension and confinement in jail, so that I get him--and fifteen dollars for Simon, as above. I have reason to believe that both of them are now lurking in Franklin County.<BR>FANNING JONES.<BR>Wake County, June 2, 1820.<BR>23-tf
