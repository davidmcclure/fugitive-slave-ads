Transcript: Ten Dollars reward.<BR>RANAWAY on the 20th inst. my negro Anthony, about twenty two years of age, very black, wide mouthed, strongly made, went off well dressed, a description of which I am not able to give. I suppose him to be about five feet eight or nine inches high--and it is conjectured he has made for the lower Part of this state, as there were some waggons going to Fayetteville about the 22nd inst. and a negro was seen lurking after the same, which I suppose to be the said runaway. Any person taking up said negro and confining him in any jail so I get him again, shall be entitled to the above reward.<BR>FRED.[Frederick?] MILLER.<BR>Rowan county, N.C. 15 miles east}<BR>of Salisbury.}<BR>25-4ts.
