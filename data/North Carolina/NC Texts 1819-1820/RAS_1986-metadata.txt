Transcript: Ran away from the Subscriber on the 3d inst. a negro boy named GEORGE. He is 18 or 19 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, of a dark mulatto color, well made, and of good appearance. He had a green cloth short coat, a blue plains short jacket, and a furr hatt[sic] somewhat worn, when went away. He is generally very neat in wearing his clothes. He was brought from Washington county, and has been my servant for the four last years. It is supposed he is in company with one or two other negroes that belong to persons in Halifax county. As he left me without any provocation, he will probably aim for Norfolk, or some other seaport town, in order to secure his final escape. Any person apprehending and securing him in gaol, or delivering him to Mr. Peter Evans, in Edgecombe county, shall be liberally rewarded. He has travelled considerably, and may endeavor to pass himself for a free fellow.<BR>George E. Spruiil.<BR>Scotland Neck, Halifax County,<BR>Jan. 13, 1820.
