Transcript: One hundred dollars reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, on the 3rd July 1819, two negroes, one man named Jacob, about thirty five years old, of yellow complexion, about five feet ten inches high, when spoken to answers very quick. When he ranaway from me he carried with him one blue coat and pantaloons of common broad cloth, one pair ditto of green homespun, double wove, and one new furred hat and one pair of boots. The woman named Jude, about forty years old, little inclined to yellow, of a thin visage, thick lips, with a brazen look. When she left she carried off two silk frocks, one of them were black, and the other checked, one bonnet, of a red changeable silk. Jacob is a very sensible cunning fellow and will try to pass by the name of John Bell, he can read--Jude will pass by the name of Vilet Horn, as she has procured a pass from a woman by that name. I will give the above reward to any person delivering them to me or securing them in any jail so that I get them again.<BR>EZEKIEL STATON.<BR>Tarborough, July 25, 1819.
