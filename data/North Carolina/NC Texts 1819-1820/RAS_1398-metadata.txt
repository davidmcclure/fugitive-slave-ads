Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber living within one mile of Wadesboro' Anson county; on the 4th day of this month (June,) my Negro Man, WILLIS, about 22 years of age, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, dark complexion. Willis is a very stout, likely, sensible fellow, will probably attempt to pass himself for a freeman; he wore away a blue cloth coat, green pantaloons, and fur hat; he was raised in Norfolk Virginia by a Mr. Sharp, where I expect he will try to get; he can read and write his name, has some knowledge of figures, beats the drum and plays the fife. The above reward will be paid to any person who will deliver the said Negro to me, or secure him in any jail in the state so that I get him again.<BR>ARCHIBALD SMITH.<BR>Wadesboro, June 18<BR>27-4t[?]
