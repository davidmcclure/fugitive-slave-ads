Transcript: NOTICE.<BR>LAST evening runaway from the subscriber, a negro girl, by the name of JIN, eighteen or nineteen years of age, about five feet high, tolerable dark colour, with a scar on her jaw near her ear, about one inch long, her small toes are uncommonly short, and her big toe considerably the longest. She is supposed to be half gone with child, and is a likely girl. She took with her two cotton frocks, one copperas checked, and the other is striped with blue, and one filled with black yarn, one pair of red morocco shoes, & 1 pair of white cotton stockings. I suppose she went off with a mulatto boy of Dorris Cannady's. It is likely they will pass together as free people; and may take up their habitation in some[?] town, for employment a while, and then make for some free state. It is likely they will have some company with them. If any person will bring her to me or confine her in jail so that I can get her again, they shall have a reward of 30 dollars.<BR>FREDERICK BECK.<BR>Granville county, N.C. August 26, 1819<BR>36S1p
