Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from aboard my Flat at Handcock's wharf, on the 25th of March, a Negro man named EPHRAIM, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, middling black, has a white bunch of hair on his forehead just under his hat, and a scar over one of his eyes resembling a burn, is a native of Guinea, speaks very broken English, and is slim built.--He wore off a copperas striped pair of trowsers; and it is likely he will lurk about Newbern with a view of getting away in some vessel.  He is a very ignorant fellow, but a good hand to work.  The above reward will be given to any person to confine him in any prison in the State.  All persons are forwarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying him away, under penalty of the law.<BR>RICHARD MOORE.<BR>March 27, 1819.    53tf
