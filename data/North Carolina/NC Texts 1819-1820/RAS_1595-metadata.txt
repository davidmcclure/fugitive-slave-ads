Transcript: RANAWAY from the subscriber, the 8th May, 1820, a bright Mulatto man, by the name of ISHAM, six fee[t] high, about thirty five years of age, raw bone, and active, slow spoken, with one of his foreteeth out, has a swelled testacle, and was in the habit, while at home, of wearing a truss--also has a small bit of the lower part of one of his ears cut off, scarcely descernable[sic]. Said fellow was confined about five or six years ago, in Beaufort Jail, Carteret county, where, it is probable he may now make for. He attempted to pass as a free man when he ran away before. I will give a reward of twenty dollars, if delivered to me or confined in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>T. ALSTON.<BR>May 15.<BR>29tf.
