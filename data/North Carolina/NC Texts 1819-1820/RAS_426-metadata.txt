Transcript: 100 Dollars<BR>REWARD.<BR>I WILL give a reward of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for the apprehension and delivery to me in Wayne County, of my Negro Man<BR>Jack,<BR>or for the securing him in any Jail within the State, so that I get him again.<BR>He is a tall fellow, spare built, and very black ; has red looking eyes, his front teeth defective, and is about 30 years of age.<BR>I suppose him to be lurking about Newbern, or the Plantation of William Gaston, Esq. (on Brice's Creek) of whom I bought him -- Jack, however, has an extensive connexion and acquaintance, and I am told, is at times in Jones County, about a Plantation called Racoon, belonging to John Stanly, Esq. of Newbern, and occasionally at White-Oak about a Plantation belonging to William P. Ferrand, Esq. of Swansborough, and may probably be sometimes at Swansborough, where his mother lives, who belongs to Mr. Ferrand.<BR>N. WASHINGTON.<BR>August 12th, 1820--126tf.
