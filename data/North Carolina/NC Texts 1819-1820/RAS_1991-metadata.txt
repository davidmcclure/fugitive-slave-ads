Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>For the apprehension of a Mulatto Slave named<BR>FRED<BR>He is about 16 or 18 years old, very well grown, and in height from five feet 7 to 10 inches high, rather slim for his height, has a mulatto complexion and a bashful countenance; his hair naturally curls, but lately has been cut close to his head. He is very artful and ingenious, and has passed himself as free-born in this place, and will endeavour to procure a free pass. He took off with him a Japan hat, a black broad cloth coat, mixed surtcoat and other good clothes. It supposed his objective will be to get to a sea port, (probably Edenton or Plymouth) in order to get off in some vessel; or he will shape his course of Sampson County and Wilmington, where he was raised. I will give the above reward to any person who will confine him in any jail, and give me information of the same, or Thomas Burgess or John R. Leigh, Esq. so that I get him again. Captains of vessels are requested to keep a look out and secure said boy.<BR>William H. Williams<BR>Halifax, (N.C.) June 27, 1820.
