Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 3d inst. a very bright Mulatto man named JERRY.  He is about 24 years of age, five feet 8 or 10 inches high, a stout bony fellow, thick lips, high red cheeks, brown coarse hair, rather straight.  He is stoop-shouldered, and rocks as he walks.  He has a very downcast look, and will be easily confounded if closely questioned.  He probably had on a dark brown or black Homespun Coat and white woollen and cotton pantaloons, and carried away other clothing, which cannot be particularly described.<BR>He absconded last year, and was apprehended and confined in Guilford jail.  I cannot guess what route he may now take, he will pass for a free person I expect, as he is nearly white, he did so before, and called himself William Thomas.<BR>I will give the above reward to any person that will secure him in jail so that I get him again or deliver him to me.<BR>JOHN McADEN<BR>Caswell Co. Nov. 8th, 1823.    60--3t
