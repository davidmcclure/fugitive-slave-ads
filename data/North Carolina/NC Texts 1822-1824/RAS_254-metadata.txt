Transcript: $20 Reward.<BR>ABSCONDED in the month of September last, my negro man SAM, who has since called himself TOM. He is a stout built, black and rust looking fellow, about five feet high, and weighs about 150 or 180. He had a snuff colored broadcloth big coat, and the balance of his clothes dark mixt homespun, when he went away.  He reads print very well, and is a shrewd artful fellow, but cannot write--he may however have obtained free papers and changed his clothes, and is probably endeavoring to get into a free State.  He has no connections in the world that I know of.  I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver the said fellow to me on Dan River in Stokes county, N. Carolina, or secure him in any jail so that I get him again, and all reasonable charges paid.<BR>ARMISTEAD ABBOTT.<BR>Feb. 2, 1824    25 2m
