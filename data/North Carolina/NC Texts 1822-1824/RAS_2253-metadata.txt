Transcript: Thirty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 12th of May last, a NEGRO MAN, about 25 or 26 years of age, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high; he has a small hole, about the size of a pen, on the side of his eye, a very bad scar on one of his shoulders, occasioned by a burn; on which shoulder I do not recollect. He was raised in Nansemund county, Virginia, near Suffolk. I will give a reward of thirty dollars to any person who will apprehend said negro, and deliver him to me, in Granville county, near Goshen, or a reasonable satisfaction for securing him in jail, so that I get him again.<BR>CARTER WOOD.
