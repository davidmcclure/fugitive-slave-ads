Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber in Wake county, North-Carolina twelve miles north of Raleigh, on the 15th of August last, a negro man by the name of STEPHEN, rather light complexion, about forty years of age; he is quite unassuming, and a tolerable shoemaker. He took off with him some clothing. It is to be feared he has procured a pass as there was one taken from him on the 16th instant, which stated he was a free man, by the name of James Peterford. He has a very noted mark over his right eye, just above the eye brow, (occasioned by a blow,) he is about five feet seven or eight inches high. The above reward will be given for the apprehension of said negro if found in any other county, and ten dollars if found in this county.<BR>SOLOMON THOMPSON.<BR>April 27, 1824.  48 5tp
