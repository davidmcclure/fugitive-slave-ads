Transcript: Ran-away,<BR>FROM the subscriber about the 1st inst. in the city of Raleigh, N.C. a likely bright mulatto girl named BARBARY, about sixteen years of age, spare made, bushy head of hair, and carried off a bundle of clothes.  I think it probable she went off towards Tarborough, N.C. or in some one of the states under the protection of some white person or persons, and very probable she may have a free pass.  I will give a reasonable reward for her apprehension, so that I get her again.<BR>ROBERT CANNON.<BR>January 15, 1824.    18-3w<BR>N.B. As the mother of Barbary lives in Martin county, she may travel that course.
