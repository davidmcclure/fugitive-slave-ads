Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, living in Fayetteville, N.C. about the month of December. 1821 a Negro Man by the name of<BR>JIM,<BR>35 or 40 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, stout built, dark complexion, and grum countenance. He was purchased about three years ago of Mr. Donald M'Rae, of this county; he formerly belonged to Mrs. M'Iver of Moore County, where I believe he was raised: he is well known in this, Chatham and Moore Counties, by the name of Jim M'Leod, through which counties his range extends, I understand he has been seen in the neighborhood of Deep River, having in his possesion[sic] a pass, and being a cunning and intelligent fellow, may deceive many. A reward of 15 Dollars will be given to any person that will lodge the said negro in any jail so that I get him again, or twenty dollars if delivered to me in Fayetteville.<BR>J. A. Mumford.<BR>Feb. 27.--39 2w.
