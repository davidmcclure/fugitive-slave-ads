Transcript: RAN AWAY.<BR> On the night of the 18th inst. a negro woman named Irena; she is tall and slender made, of a dark complexion, walks a little stooping; she took with her five frocks, two homespun, one plain white, and the other blue striped; one white spotted muslin, a black canton crape, a brown figured bombazette; her hands are very much stained with blue dye. I expect she will make towards Virginia, as she was brought for that State. Any person taking up the said negro, and delivering her to me in Salisbury, or confining her in any jail, so that I get her, shall receive a reasonable reward. <BR> WILLIAM HOWARD.<BR> Salisbury, March 20, 1834.
