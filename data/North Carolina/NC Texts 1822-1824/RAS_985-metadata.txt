Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber living in Guilford county, on the 20th June, 1823, two negroes, CALEB and JUDY.--Caleb is about thirty years of age, light complexion, stout made, broad across the shoulders, speaks slowly, and is about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high.  He has a long, loping walk, and bends forward considerably, as he walks; he has marks of the whip.  He had on when he went away, a brown bombazett surtout coat, a striped (yarn) black and white, jacket, blue cotton pantaloons, and a wool hat.<BR>Judy is about forty years of age, middle size, copper coloured, quick spoken, and blinks her eyes very much, when detected in an error. She also has the mark of the whip.  Judy took among other clothing the following with her: blue grounded cotton calico frock and two muslin ones, and an old fashioned black silk bonnet.  She is an excellent Weaver.<BR>I suppose they are lurking about as free persons.  I will give the above reward for their delivery to me, or confinement in Jail, so that I get them, or in proportion for either.<BR>ABRAHAM PEEPLES.<BR>Guilford county, April 28, 1824.  49-3m
