Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on Friday last, a mulatto boy, called HARRY, about 20 years of age, badly grown, would not weigh more than 115 or 120, left handed, very awkward at any out door work, having been raised a house servant. The little finger of his right hand is still sore from a recent cut by chopping. He also has a little scar on his forehead above his right eye.<BR>He wore away a round jacket, and pantaloons, of brown yarn homespun, much worn, which, it is likely, he may change, as I expect he will endeavor to pass as a free boy.<BR>For the delivery of him to me in this place, or in any jail so that I get him again, I will pay the above reward.<BR>JO HAWKINS.<BR>Raleigh, April 21, 1823<BR>17-tf.
