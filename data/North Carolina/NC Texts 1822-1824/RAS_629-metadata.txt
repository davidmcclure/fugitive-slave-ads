Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, a few days ago, two negroes, STELLA and JACOB. Stella is between 35 and 37 years of age, about the ordinary size, and yellow complexion.  Jacob, her son, is about 19 years of age, slender made, yellow complexion, and has had his right hand burned, so as to draw up his fingers.  Stella and Jacob are probably lurking about this place, or Tarborough.  They may possibly have gone by the way of Washington.--The above reward, and all reasonable expenses, will be paid to any person who will apprehend and deliver said negroes to me; or secure them in any Jail so that I get them, and give immediate information thereof; or TEN DOLLARS for either of them.<BR>JNO.[JOHN] R. LEIGH.<BR>Newbern, May 29, 1824.--'23 tf.
