Transcript: Ran away<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 27th of February, a dark mulatto Negro Woman, named PENNY, about 27 years of age, large and fleshy.  She has the rheumatism in her ancles which causes her to limp a little when she walks.  She speaks short and has a grim look.  A reasonable reward will be given to any person who will apprehend her and commit her to Jail.  I expect she is in the neighborhood of Raleigh, where I bought her.<BR>ALEX [ALEXANDER] BOYD, Jr.<BR>March 5.    35 tf
