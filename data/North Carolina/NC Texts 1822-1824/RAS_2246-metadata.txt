Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Nash county, N.C. a negro boy, named ALLEN, about the 15th May, 1822. He went off without provocation. He is between 18 and 20 years of age, spare made, yellow complexion, his weight was between 130 and 140, and has an impediment in his speech when spoken to. This boy has near relations at the Falls of Tar river, owned by Henry A. Donaldson, Esq.[Esquire] He also has connexions owned by Mr. George Wimboley, who has a quarter of negroes on Tar river, in Edgecombe county. It is quite likely he is lurking about those gentlemen's plantation. I have thought this boy has been harboured and protected by some persons living in this county. I will give twenty-five dollars reward for their detection, so that they can be brought to have their deserts, and twenty-five dollars for the boy, to be delivered to me, or secured in jail, so that I get him.<BR>MICH.[Michael] COLLINS.<BR>August 23, 1823<BR>N.B. Should the boy not come in shortly, I shall outlaw him.
