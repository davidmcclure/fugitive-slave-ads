Transcript: Notice. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 10th of May last, a negro man by the name of BILL, or (William,) five feet eight or inches high, about twenty-four years of age, well made, and weighs one hundred and ninety. He is quite  black and, what is remarkable for so young a negro, his upper fore teeth are rotten out to  his gums. He has a small scar on his forehead, over his left eye, and a scar (as if cut with a knife) across his forehead, a little below his hair. Bill is well known in and about Raleigh, as a notorious thief, and will, no doubt, readily be enticed to go off with a kidnapper. A liberal reward will be given for apprehending him, so that I get him again. Bill is outlawed. <BR>  Wake County, June 10, 1823. <BR> JNO.[John] W. CHARLES.
