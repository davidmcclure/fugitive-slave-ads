Transcript: Ran away, or Stolen,<BR>FROM the subscriber, on the 4th July, a mulatto fellow named BILL, 23 or 24 years of age, 5 feet, 4 or 5 inches high, with a remarkable singular mark on the right side of his nose, rather of a purple colour, has clothing not recollected; he has been in the jail of Salisbury.<BR>  I will give a reward of 100 dollars to any person who will deliver said negro to me, or secure him in jail so that I may get him; or 25 dollars if stolen, on delivery of him and the thief. If he has a free pass, I will give a reward of 50 dollars, for the delivery of him and the person who gave it to him, upon it being satisfactorily proven that he is the person. I purchased said negro of Dr. Isaac Philips, of Rockingham county. <BR> The above fellow, since he was first advertised, has been confined in Fayetteville jail, from whence I took him on the 18th ult. He again ran away or was inveigled away, from me, on the 1st day of this month. If it can be made to appear that the said fellow is harbored or befriended by any person, I will give $100 reward for the delivery of the person who befriends him. <BR> SAMUEL GUY.<BR>Iredell County, Sept, 3, 1823.  70
