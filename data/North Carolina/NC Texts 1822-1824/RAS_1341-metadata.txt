Transcript: Thirty dollars reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 4th day of June, a light mulatto man named<BR>MOSES,<BR>about 25 years of age, five feet 10 inches high or thereabouts. He has straight hair, blue eyes, red whiskers, remarkable white teeth, a down look, and but of few words. Persons not knowing him, would take him to be a freeman; but on examination would soon find that he is not. He was the property of John Leath, of Hyde County, I have understood he was making his way to Edton, by the way Mattamuskeet and Alligator.--The above reward will be paid on delivering him to me in the town of Washington, and all necessary expences[sic], or $20 if lodged in any jail in the State so that I get him. All persons are forwarned from harboring, employing, or carrying him off at their peril. <BR>BANISTER MIDYETT.<BR>Washington. June 20, 1822--4w366.
