Transcript: Five Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN away from the subscriber on the night of the 14th inst. (April) a negro woman named Anica, or Anna. She is about twenty years of age, of a low stature; if there are any marks on her, I don't remember them. I suppose she is harbored about the plantation of Mr. Noah Partee, who owns her husband. The above reward will be given to any one who will deliver said negro to me.<BR>JNO.[JOHN] BEARD, Senr.<BR> April 26, 1823.
