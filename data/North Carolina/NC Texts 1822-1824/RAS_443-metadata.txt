Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Mecklenburg county, N.C. on the night of the 11th instant, two negro boys named PETER and GILES. Peter is about 25 years of age, about 5 feet high, stout made, and of light complexion, with large black whiskers and black beard. He had on when he went away, a blue broad-cloth round-about, dark coloured pantaloons, black wool hat, a good pair of shoes, with peg'd soles, and iron-plated heels. Giles is about 21 years of age, about 6 feet high, stout made, and very black; has a large scar on the right side of his face, occasioned by a burn, just below his eye, also a very large scar on his breast. He had on when he went away, white negro cotton round-about, pantaloons and waistcoat, a white fur hat, with a very high crown, and an old pair of shoes considerably run down at the knees. Any person taking up said negroes, and confining them in any goal, so that I get them, or delivering them to me, shall receive the above reward, and all expenses paid. <BR> CARNES H. HENDERSON.<BR> Mecklenburg Co. N.C.<BR> June 15, 1822.  3wt'8r
