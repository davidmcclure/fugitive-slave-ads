Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 28th of March last, a negro man named JIM; known in Newbern and about Mr. Gaston's plantation, by the name of Jim Sparrow.  He has a yellow cast in his skin, though nearly black--about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, spare made, thick lips, and a good set of teeth, which he is apt to shew [sic] when spoken to--25 or 26 years of age, though he has a younger appearance.
