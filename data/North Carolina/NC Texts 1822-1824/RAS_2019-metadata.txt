He has straight hair, blue eyes, red whiskers, remarkable white teeth, a down look, and but of few words.

I have have understood he was making his way to Edenton, by the name of Mattamuskeet and Alligator. The above reward will be paid on delivering him to me in the town of Washington, and all necessary expences, or $20 if lodged in any jail in the State so that I get him. All persons are forwarned from harboring, employing, or carrying him off at their peril.<BR>Banister Midyett.<BR>Washington, (N.C.) June 20, 1822.
