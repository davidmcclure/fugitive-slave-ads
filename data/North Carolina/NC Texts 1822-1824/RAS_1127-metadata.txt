Transcript: Forty Dollars Reward,<BR>FOR GEORGE and ISAAC. George ran away the first September last; about 5 feet 10 inches high; tolerable black; spare made; thin visage; some teeth out before; about 20 years of age. He has a wife at Speercofield's quarter, on Fishing creek, and is well known as a rascal to the citizens in the neighborhood he visits. He was caught at Speercofield's quarter when brought home last, and no doubt is lurking and harbored in the neighborhood. I will give Twenty Dollars for his delivery to me, or I will give FORTY DOLLARS for his head, and no questions asked.<BR>ISAAC went off the 12th instant; is about 5 feet 4 inches high; of a pumpkin black color; well made; active and lively; expert in wrestling, running and jumping; about 23 years of age; has a wife at Mrs. Applewhite's, and I am confident is in that neighborhood. The said negroes I purchased at Sheriff's Sale of the estate of Wm.[William] Lowry, deceased. I will give Twenty Dollars for Isaac, delivered to me, or fifteen if confined in jail so that I get him.<BR>Hilliard Fort.<BR>July 23, 1824.<BR>19--tf
