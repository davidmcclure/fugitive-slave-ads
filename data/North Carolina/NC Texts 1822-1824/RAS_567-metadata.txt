Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Wake county, on the 18th of May last, his negro man NED, about 21 years old, his weight about 150, well made, spry and active tolorably fierce look, a little inclined to be yellow, his upper fore teeth a little defective, and, I expect, has some signs of the whip on his hips and thighs, as he was a whipped in that way the day before  he went off. He will perhpas get a free pass, and endeavor to pass for a free man, as he is connected with free negroes. I will give the above reward, and pay all reasonble expenses, so that I get him again. <BR> GREEN ALFORD. <BR> July 3, 1823.
