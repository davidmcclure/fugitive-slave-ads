Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the night of the 8th inst. a bright mulatto man, named Sam, between 30 and 40 years of age, five feet 7 inches or 8 inches high, and midling heavy made, black and straight hair, with large whiskers extending round under his chin, bold spoken, and not a very pleasant countenance; has, perhaps, some scars on his head. I expect he will try to pass for a white man, or at least for a free man, and may have some kind of a false certificate or free pass, as the like has been lately found in his possession, in which he called himself Samuel Knox, signed by several names, but all the same hand. If he procures another, he may give himself some other name. He also took with him his wife, named Grace, about 25 years of age, a stout hearty woman, perhaps taller than him, large boned, straight and trim made, pleasant countenance, and not a very black negro. She has a scar on the calf of her right leg, occasioned by a burn. She is in the habit of wearing her hair midling long, and combed up to the top of her head, and tied. They have both been raised near Hill's Iron Works, York, S.C. If they leave that, I expect they will make either to the north or west. Any person taking up said negroes, and delivering them to me, living in Mecklenburg county, N.C. near Charlotte, shall receive the above reward and all reasonable expences paid; or $15, if confined in any jail, and a letter sent to me by the mail, to Charlotte.<BR> JAMES M. BLACK.<BR> June 14, 1823.
