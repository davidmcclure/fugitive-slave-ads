Transcript: Stop the Runaway! <BR> RAN away from the subscriber, on the 4th instant, a negro boy named George, about 28 or 30 years of age, of yellow complexion, long chin, high forehead, speaks slow and distinctly, has a down cast look, and has lost some of his fore teeth. He appears older than he really is. He took away with him an old horse, with a bald face, about 14 or 15 years of age, and about 16 hands high; one black horse three years old, about 15 hands high, and much rubbed working in the wagon. He took with him a white girl, 18 or 20 years of age, sandy hair, rather inclined to be red, large and full breasted. It is more than probable that he will attempt to pass, in consequence of having the girl with him. I will give any reasonable premium to any person that will take the aforesaid negro and horses into his possession, so that the subscriber may get him.<BR> DANIEL VERBLE.<BR> Salisbury, April 5, 1823.--48tf
