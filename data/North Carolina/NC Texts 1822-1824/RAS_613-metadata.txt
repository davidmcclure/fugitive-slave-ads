Transcript: TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS<BR>REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 28th instant, a Mulatto fellow named<BR>JERRY;<BR>about five feet ten or eleven inches high; one leg more bowed than the other, thin visage, has remarkable large feet--is artful, cunning, and rather impudent when spoken to.  He has a wife at Simon Foscue's, in my neighbourhood, and a mother at Benjamin D. Gray's, on the Neuse Road, near the plantation of John C. Stanly; about which places, and between them and Newbern, he will likely be found lurking.<BR>It is probable that he will attempt to escape from the State by water, and if so, he will no doubt make towards Wilmington or Washington.<BR>I will give the above reward for his head, or ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS if delivered to me alive, or confined in any jail, so that I get him again.<BR>All persons are forbid harbouring or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law.<BR>FREDERICK FOY.<BR>Jones County, August 29th, 1823--85tf
