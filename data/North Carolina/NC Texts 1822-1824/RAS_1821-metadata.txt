Transcript: STOP THE THIEF.<BR>A REWARD of TEN DOLLARS will be paid for apprehending my mulatto boy<BR>BEN,<BR>well known in town as a barber, having lived with John Green, for a number of years in that capacity. He entered my room sometime during the night, and rifled my Pocket Book, of the following sum in money, viz: one ten dollar bill, bank not recollected; two five dollar bills, W. B. State Bank, new; one two dollar bill, Cape-Fear, torn from one end almost to the other, and two single dollar bills, in all twenty-four dollars; there are also sundry articles of clothing missing, such as shirts, blue frock coat, with a large cape, blue close body coat, and a pair of blue cloth pantaloons--and doubtless many other articles are taken, not at this moment recollected. His mother lives at the plantation of John D. Jones, Esq. and will probably be lurking about the sound; he may also go as far as Topsail, where he as some acquaintances--Masters of vessels are cautioned not to harbor or carry him away, as the law will be rigidly enforced.<BR>JOHN MACCOLL.<BR>August 14      tf
