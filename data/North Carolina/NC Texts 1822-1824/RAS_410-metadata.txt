Transcript: $50 Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY on Saturday Morning last, a small yellow fellow called HARRY, 22 years of age, about 4 feet 10 inches high, weighs 122 lbs. or thereabouts, well made, bushy head of hair, but when cut close is rather straight, pleasing countenance when spoken to, and very polite, having been raised a house servant.<BR>I suspect he carried two $20 Newbern notes with him, together with a blue broad cloth coat, a black crape frock or surtout coat lined with silk, a pair of brown cassimere pantaloons patched in the seat, a spencer and pair of pantaloons of common homespun cloth dyed in part with copperas, a pretty good hat and bootees, all of which he will exchange if in his power.<BR>His object is to pass as a free man, and no doubt will aim for some large town, having on a former trip got near Wilmington in four days from this place, under the name of Martin Fogg.  He is a keen artful little fellow and will (as he said he did on the first trip) keep the most public road when travelling.<BR>I will give for the securing of him in any Jail so that I get him, the sum of $25 provided he is taken in this state, and $50 if he is taken, secured, &c. without the limits of it.<BR>JO.[Joseph] HAWKINS.<BR>Raleigh, N.C. July 12th, 1824<BR>The Editors of the Newbern, Edenton, Wilmington and Hillsborough papers, are requested to insert the above 3 times, and forward their accounts to me for payment.  J.H.
