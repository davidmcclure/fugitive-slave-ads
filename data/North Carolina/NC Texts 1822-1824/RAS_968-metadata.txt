Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber living in the upper edge of Wake county, on the evening of the 24th December 1823, his Negro Man MARTIN. Said negro is 28 years of age, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, square built, dark complexion, but well favored.--He had on when he went away, a suit of dark clothing, nearly new, with a slick fur hat.  Upon the instep of his right foot, on examination, there will be found a large scar caused by a cut from a club-axe, and on one of his hands, between the wrist and forefinger, he has a knot or wen, about the size of a rifle hull.<BR>It is believed that the negro has availed himself of the papers of a free negro, by the name of STUART, and will endeavor to pass himself off as the person described therein.--It is probable he has left the State, and to secure his apprehension, I will give the above reward if taken out of the limits of the State, and if taken in the State, I will give for his delivery to me, Twenty-five Dollars.<BR>JOHN WILLIAMS.<BR>Wake county, aan.[Jan?] 28.    12 wtf
