Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 10th instant, a bright Mulatto Man named JERRY.  He is about 24 years of age, near 6 feet high, a stout, bony fellow, thick red lips, dark red cheeks, freckled face, brown coarse hair, rather straight, stoop-shouldered, rocks as he walks, and he has a very downcast look when addressed.  He will be easily confounded if closely questioned.  He had on a pair of homespun dark brown woollen and cotton pantaloons, an old cambric shirt, an old hat, and was barefooted.  It is possible he may have been flattered away, or have procured a pass as a free person, as he left me without any known cause or previous preparation.  I have no knowledge of the course he will pursue.  He may possibly change his name, and call himself Jerry Thomas, as one Thomas was supposed to be his father.<BR>The above reward will be given for his delivery to me, or securing him in Jail so that I get him again.<BR>JOHN M'ADEN.<BR>Caswell, N.C. June 20.    88 5t
