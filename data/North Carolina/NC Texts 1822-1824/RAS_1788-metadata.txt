Transcript: STATESVILLE, March 24, 1823.<BR> RAN AWAY, from this place, on the night of the 23rd March, two negro men. James calling himself James Dill, who says he is free, is a black negro, rather under the common size, about 24 years of age. Isaac, the property of the subscriber, and others, is well built, middle sized man, about 30 years of age, very black. I will give fifty dollars for apprehending either of said negroes and confining them so that I get them again. <BR>1wp   ROBERT SIMONTON.
