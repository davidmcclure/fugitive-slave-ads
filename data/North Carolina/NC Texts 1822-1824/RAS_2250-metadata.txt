Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, in Montgomery county, N.C. on the 18th ultimo, a negro boy, by the name of BILL, inclined to be yellow, about twenty-five years of age. He is quite assuming, and a tolerable shoemaker, and had on, when he left, a coarse white roundabout coat and yellow yarn pantaloons; he also took off with him several other clothes, and a parcel of shoemaker's tools, some leather, and a quantity of manufactured tobacco. It is to be feared he has procured a pass, and will endeavour to pass as a free negro. The above reward will be given for the detection and deliverance of said negro, and reasonable charges paid.<BR>JOHN BETHUNE.<BR>March 3, 1824.
