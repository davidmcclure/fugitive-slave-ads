Transcript: $20 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber's plantation in Chatham county, about the first of April last, a negro man named GEORGE.  He is of rather small stature, very black, and of a pleasing countenance.  He is about twenty-one or two years of age.  He was purchased last spring at the sale of George Luther's property, and I expect is lurking in the neighborhood of his former owner, upon Cape Fear river, or has gone to the county of Gates, where he was raised and where Mr. Luther got him by his wife.  I will give the above reward, and all reasonable charges, to whoever will apprehend and deliver George to me; and I will give a reward of fifty dollars, upon the conviction of any person who has been guilty of harboring supporting or employing him since he ran away, or who shall have given him a forged or false pass.<BR>J.A. CAMPERON.<BR>Deep River, June 15, 1823.    3tf<BR>The Editor of the Star at Raleigh, and the Edenton Gazette, will publish this advertisement four times, and send their accounts to the Observer Office for payment.
