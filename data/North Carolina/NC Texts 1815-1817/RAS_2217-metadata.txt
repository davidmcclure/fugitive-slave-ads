Transcript: Runaway<BR>FROM the subscriber on Monday morning last my negro man JERRY, at least six feet high, rather of a yellow complexion, has an impudent look, reads pretty well, about 25 years of age and well formed. He wore away a new black furred hat, old shoes, a blue homespun surtout coat, besides other clothing, and one Dutch Blanket. He was raised in Johnston county, by Mr. Willis Hinton, but I rather expect he will endeavor to pass for a free man. He has worked three years at the Blacksmith's trade. I will give a handsome reward for his apprehension and confinement and jail so that I get him again.<BR>LEWIS HOLLOMON.<BR>Nov. 8, 1816.
