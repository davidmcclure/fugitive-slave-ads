Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber about the 20th of July, a Negro Girl named SARY, about 15 years old, low and chunky built, yellow complexion, has a grim look; and has a large scratch on one of her cheeks. I lately purchased her of the Rev. James Woodbury, of Edenton, where perhaps, she will endeavour to go; but I think it more likely she is harbored about Raleigh, as her father and other relations live in about this city. I will give a reward of five dollars for her if taken up in this county; if out of this county ten dollars to any one that will secure her in any jail so that I get her again.<BR>S. BOND.<BR>Raleigh, August 10, 1815.
