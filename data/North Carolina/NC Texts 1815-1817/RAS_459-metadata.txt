Transcript: 20 DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RAN-AWAY from the Subscriber on the 19th inst. a negro Man named <BR>HOWARD. <BR>formerly the property of the heirs of M'Lin's of Newbern, at which place I think it most likely he will harbour, as the most of his family connexions[sic] are there. He is about 30 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, and of a very yellow complexion. The fellow may be identified by searching his left hand, which has the little finger and the next to it drawn up by being burn'd. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver said negro to me. <BR>John Cobb. <BR>Lenoir County, Aug 22. 1816.
