Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the night of the 19th instant, a negro man named TOM, about 22 years old, yellow complexion, near six feet high, straight built, speaks very plain when unembarrassed, but stammers a little if alarmed, has very thick lips.--It is likely he will attempt to pass as a free man, as I have reason to to believe he has a free pass. I think it likely he will attempt to go to Norfolk in Virginia. I will give the above reward for the said negro if delivered to me in Wayne County, and pay all reasonable expences, or 15 dollars if secured in any jail in this State.<BR>HOPTON COOR.<BR>Wayne County, 22d Feb. 1815.
