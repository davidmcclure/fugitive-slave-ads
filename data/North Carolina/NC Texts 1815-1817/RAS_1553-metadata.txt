Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>From Raleigh on the 25th instant,<BR>A BLACK MAN, by the name of ABRAM about five feet two inches high, well set, and about 40 years of age, a tolerably good Shoemaker and Cooper--at the Shoemaking he has worked the year past with Mr. Joseph G Bacon of this place.  I expect he will make to Murfreesborough in Herford County, in this State, where he is well known, as he was bro't[brought] to this place by a Mr. Allen Clark, and sold to me in June, 1813.  I expect he has a Pass, as I understand he was wishing to get one wrote, as he said he wished to go after his wife Nancy, a free mulatto, who is said to be in the neighbourhood of the Borough with one of her children.--I forewarn all persons from harbouring or employing him in any way, or from carrying him either by land or water, as I shall be under the disagreebale necessity of putting the law in force against all such persons--but will satisfy any reasonable person who may bring him to me, or deliver him in Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>J. SCOTT.<BR>Raleigh, March 28.    62
