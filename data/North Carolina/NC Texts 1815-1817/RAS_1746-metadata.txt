Transcript: RUNAWAY.--Made his escape from the subscriber, on Wednesday evening last, A NEGRO MAN, named JACK about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, 30 years of age, walk somewhat as if had been crippled, and is remarkable about the ears and nose, having had the former pinched off-and the latter much scarred--He ran off about the 4th day of January last, from Mr. John M'Lleod, of Johnston, and had been put in Hillsborough Jail, from whence I was taking him home. Any person arresting [s]aid negro man and lodging him in any  Jail shall be handsomely rewarded by me who will pay all necessary expences.<BR> NICHOLAS LYNCH.<BR> Feb. 14, 1817.
