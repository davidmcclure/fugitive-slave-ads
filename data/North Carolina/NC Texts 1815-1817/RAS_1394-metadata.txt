Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber about the last week in November, a Negro man by the name of SIMON, or generally SI for shortness; very black complexion, with a scar on the side of the forehead, a part of it within and extending beyond the edge of the hair, received from the kick of a horse, eyes inclined to be red. He will endeavor to work at the blacksmith's business having been employed occasionally that way, he took with him it is suspected a sum of money stolen from a person in the neighbourhood--his clothes not recollected, and as he had several changes, unnecessary to describe. The above reward will be given to secure him in any jail in this State so that I get him again, and if delivered to me all reasonable compensation made.<BR>JOHN ADAMS.<BR>Greenesville, Feb.<BR>10-1t
