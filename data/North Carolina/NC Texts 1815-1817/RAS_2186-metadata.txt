Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 15th of last month, two Negroes, one named BRISTER and the other SOLOMON, they are about the age of 18 or 19 years each, and are about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, of common complexion, stout made, strong and active, they had on when they ranaway common negro clothing, that is, coarse tow linnen, and coarse cotton shirt and trowers. I am inclined to believe they have gone again to New-Hanover County, about 20 or 25 miles west from Wilmington, and I suspect are harboured in the neighborhood of James Cufford and a Mr. Lewis's, where they were harboured in June and July last. I will give the above reward and all expences for both, if delivered to me 7 miles northwest of Raleigh, or five dollars each if secured in jail so that I get them again.<BR>G. DAVIS.<BR>Wake County, Sept. 1815.
