Transcript: Fifteen Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 13th instant, from Leasburg, Caswell county, N.C. my boy LEWIS, aged  17 or 18 years, about 5 feet four or five inches high, thick made, very black complexion, large flat nose, was raised in Hillsboro' N.C. by the family of Lockhart's, and was once taken to South Carolina, from whence he ran back to Hillsborough, from which place I lately brought him. He will likely aim for Wilmington, N.C. or Charleston, S.C. which he told some of his confidents [sic]. He will, no doubt, try to obtain a free pass, as he has made several attempts of the kind. He had on when he went away a--cloth coat, the other clothing not recollected. Whoever will take up said boy and confine him, and give me information at this place by mail or otherwise, shall receive the above reward.<BR>JOHN M'DANIEL.<BR>Leasburg, 21st March, 1816.
