Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Scotland Neck, Halifax county, about the first of December, a small Mulatto Boy, about sixteen years old.  He is active and well made, and some incline to be bow legged, and has some scars on his head and face, which were occasioned from burns.  He is a boy that is very well calculated to deceive strangers, by his artful and insinuating language, and it is probable he will attempt to pass as a free boy, though by interrogating him he may be detected.  I will give a reward of Twenty Five Dollars to any person that will deliver him to me, in Scotland Neck, Halifax county, or secure him in any jail, or give any information so that I get him again, and pay all expenses.<BR>S.A. HUNTER,<BR>August 30.    25--tf
