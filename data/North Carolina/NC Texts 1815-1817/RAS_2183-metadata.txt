Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 14th of this month, a Negro woman by the name of RUTH, is small, yellow complected and has a slick and smooth skin. I expect she will endeavour to pass for a free woman, and will, probably, alter her name. She wears, generally, a silver ring on her left hand. I suspect she is either in the neighbourhood of Raleigh, or in Wayne county, I will give ten dollars reward to any person who will apprehend and confine her in jail, and giving me information thereof.<BR>William Richardson.<BR>Johnston County, May 27, 1815.   22 4t pd
