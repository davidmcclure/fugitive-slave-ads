Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD,<BR>WILL be given for delivering to me two NEGRO MEN, DAMON & DEMPSEY. I suppose they will aim for or near the town of Washington, N. Carolina, where I purchased them of Marshal Dickerson, about the first of April last. Damon, a very black complected fellow, about six feet high, twenty two years old, quick spoken, and tolerably polite--he has lived in Fayetteville and Pittsborough, N.C. and perhaps may make to either of those places; he ran away from me in Granville county in the 21st of April last. Dempsey ran away 12th inst. in Caswell county, his complexion a little yellow, twenty six years old, about five feet high, walks very lame in one of his legs, though which leg not recollected, and one hip sunk in--Both lameness and hip sunk occasioned by rheumatic pains. I think both of them will change their names and perhaps attempt to pass as freemen. I will give Ten Dollars reward for either, or the above reward for both, if delivered to me or confined in any jail, so that I get them again.<BR>CHARLES K. HARRISON.<BR>Caswell County, 21st May, 1816.
