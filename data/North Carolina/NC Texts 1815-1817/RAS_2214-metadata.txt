Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN AWAY from the Subscriber on the 14th inst. two negro men, about 20 years of age, by the names of JIM and JOE. Jim is a yellow fellow about 5 feet 10 inches high. Joe is a black fellow, stout built, about five feet 8 or 9 inches high. The above mentioned negroes were bought sometime back in the state of Virginia and conveyed to the state of South Carolina, where I bought them; on my return to Craven county, near Newbern, they left me in Sampson county. I expect they make towards Virginia. I will give the above reward for both to be delivered to me in Craven county, near Newbern, on Swift Creek, or ten dollars for either, or I will give the same reward for them to be secured in any jail of this state and information given me so that I get them; all reasonable expences will be paid.<BR>JOSEPH WIGGINS.<BR>October 25, 1816.
