Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber about the first of January last, a Negro man by the name of LEWIS, about 25 years of age, very black, bow legged, and does not weigh more than 140--no particular marks recollected--Also, ranaway about the 15th March a negro man named ANDREW, but may perhaps assume the name of Littleton, as he did on a former occasion. This fellow was raised in Halifax county, near Edward's Ferry on Roanoke, where I expect he has gone. Stutters badly, and has small eyes--about 23 years old and of the common size--Lewis, I apprehend is lurking in my own neighborhood, and harboured by some unprincipled white men.--The above reward will be given for the delivery of both the above named negroes, or ten dollars for either, and all reasonable expences paid.<BR>D.W. DAVIS.<BR>Franklin, March 31, 1815.  14-3t
