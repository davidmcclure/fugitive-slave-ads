Esq.[Esquire] Zaccheus is about 24 years of age, about 5 feet, 9 or 10 inches high, rather of a dark complexion, quite an ingenious sensible fellow, and will in all probability undertake to pass as a free man; he is also acquainted in Petersburg, where he may think fit to lean his course; he is also well acquainted with the Fisheries on Chowan. Henry is also of a dark complexion, about 5 feet, 8 or 9 inches high. The above reward  will be given for both, or half for either, if lodged in any goal so that I get them.<BR>WM.[William] POOL.<BR>Johnston County, Dec 15, 1815. 50-4tp.
