Transcript: RANAWAY on the 6th inst. from the subscriber, living on Deep River in More county, an negro fellow named JO or Jorum. He is 20 or 23 years old, about 5 feet 10 inches high, stout and well made of a coal black color, with a scar on one of his arms. He wore away a hat made of rushes, or wiregrass, a pair of mixed cotton pantaloons, a tow shirt and stripped homespun waistcoat. The fellow was lately purchased by the subscriber in Kinston of Mr. Bryan the sheriff of Lenoir. He was raised near Newbern, and owned by Mr. William Gatlin. He will no doubt attempt to get back into the neighborhood of Kinston or Newbern, and probably may shape his course through Pittsborough, Raleigh and Smithfield. He is an arch, cunning rascal, and will doubtless always have some plausible story to tell to induce people to let him pass unsuspected. A liberal reward will be given to any person who will apprehend said negro and deliver him to me, or secure him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>PETER M'COLLUM.<BR>June 14, 1816. 29 6w
