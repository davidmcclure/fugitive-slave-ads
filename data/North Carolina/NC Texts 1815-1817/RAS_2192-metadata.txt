Transcript: RANAWAY from the subscriber on the night of the 3rd. Inst. two negro men by the names of Absalom and Cline. Absalom is about twenty-five years old, five feet eight or nine inches high, complexion a little tinged with yellow, has a scar I believe about the face; it is said he can read, and is by profession a Barber. I purchased him of Mr. Andrew Rhea. He has been about Chapel Hill for several years past, and has a wife in Raleigh. Cline is somewhat younger, about six feet high, quite black, very prominent forehead and chin, bow legged. He suffered severely last Winter by the cold, and probably retains some marks of the frost of his feet. He pretends to be a rough carpenter. A generous reward will be given for the apprehension of either of them.<BR>L. HENDERSON.<BR>Williamsboro, Granville, April 6, 1817. <BR> The Editor of Petersburg Intelligencer, will insert the above for three weeks and forward his account to the Star-Office.
