Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.-Ranaway from the subscriber living in Montgomery county, N.C. on the 12th inst. a negro man by the name of DANIEL, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, stout made, rather yellow complexion, with some of his  upper fore teeth out, and about twenty-five years of age,  had on a black-homespun coat, cotton shirt and pantaloons. I suspect he will aim for Currituck county, by way of Fayetteville and Newbern, as he was purchased in the former place last winter. The above reward will be given for apprehending the said negro, and securing him in any jail so that I may get him, and all reasonable expences paid.<BR> DUNCAN M'RAE.<BR>April 18th, 1816.<BR>47--tf.
