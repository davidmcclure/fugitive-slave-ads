Transcript: NOTICE<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Person county, North-Carolina, on the 23d of May last, a Negro Man named PETER, about 25 years of age, somewhat yellow, 5 feet 7 or eight inches high, and very well made; had on when he went away homespun clothes, except his coat, which was a sailors dress of dark color.? He absented himself from us in Rowan county about nineteen miles north of the Yadkin River-- it is expected he will aim to get back to Virginia, near to Norfolk, as he was lately purchased of Mr. Lemuel Cornio of Princess Anne county.? We fear that he will not own his masters named, in consequence of his being a very shrewd fellow.? Whoever will apprehend the said Negro Peter and confine him in any Jail or deliver him to us, or give information so that we get him, shall receive a Reward of Twenty Dollars.<BR>JESSE BRADSHER,<BR>JEREMIAH DIXON<BR>June 6.??? 73
