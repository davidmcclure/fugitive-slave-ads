Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 17th instant, my Negro Man ARCH, but will probably change his name to Willis, or James Turner, both of which names he assumed on former occasions, and by the latter attempted to pass as a free man.  The said Fellow was not long since committed to Jail in Greensville, Pitt county, and may probably make for the lower part of the State again, though he was raised in Southampton county, near Jerusalem, Virginia.  ARCH is about 23 years old, yellow complexion, has lost one fore tooth, is about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, stout and active, has had the under part of his right Ear cut off, and bears the marks of much whipping ; he looks surly and speaks slow and in a low tone.  The above Reward and all reasonable expences will be paid for his delivery to me, or for his being secured in any Jail so that I get him again,<BR>DUKE W DAVIS<BR>Franklin, April 24, 1815.    14 sf
