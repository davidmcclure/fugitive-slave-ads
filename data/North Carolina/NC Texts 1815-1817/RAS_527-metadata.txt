Transcript: 20 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, early in the month of June last, my Negro Man ROBIN, but he will probably change his name and pass as a free man, as he possesses considerable mechanical knowledge both as a Shoemaker and Carpenter.  The said Fellow ran away from me about 3 years since, and resorted much about St. Tammany on Roanoke River, where I suppsoe he is at this time, or in Petersburg, working at the Carpenter's trade, from the high wages given there in consequence of the late destructive fire.  Robin is about 45 years of age, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, of a yellow complexion, well made, talks slow, has broad teeth before, turns his toes very much out when he walks, and is very subject to intoxication.  He was shot in the left side about three years ago with small shot, the marks of which are perceptible at this time in his left shoulder, hand and thigh.  The above reward will be given, and all reasonable expences paid for his delivery to me, or for his being secured hin any Jail so that I get him again.<BR>Saml.[Samuel] Thorne.<BR>Halifax, Sept.
