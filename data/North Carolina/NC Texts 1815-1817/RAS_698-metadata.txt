Transcript: Twenty Five Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber in Richmond County, Rockingham on the 29th of October, a bright mulatto woman about thirty five years old, likely and straight built, well known in Wilmington by the name of Bessey, formerly owned by Doctor Cutlar, who sold her to Mr. Hugh Campbell, Merchant of Fayetteville. All Captains of Vessels are forwarned from employing or giving her a passage or, in any manner, and bring her on board of a vessel, as I understand her aim is to get to New York. The above reward will be given to any person who will take her up and commit her to Jail so I get her again.<BR>JOHN JENNINGS.<BR>Rockingham, Richmond, C.H. N.C.
