Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 2d of December last, a Negro by the name of GEORGE, about 24 years of age, five feet nine or ten inches high, very black, has  a large scar on his forehead occasioned by the kick of a horse, and is a little cross-eyed. He was raised by me in Johnson [sic] county, on Mark's creek.  I have some expectation that he is lurking about Raleigh, as his mother lives in town. Since he left me I have been informed that he can write and read, and perhaps may endeavour to pass for a free man. The above reward will be given to any person that will deliver him me in Johnston county, or secure him in any jail so that I get him.<BR>EDWARD LEE.<BR>July 5, 1815. 27-2wp
