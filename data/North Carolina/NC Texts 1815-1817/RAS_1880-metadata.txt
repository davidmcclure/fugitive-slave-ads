Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran or absented himself from the subscriber, his black man Tom, well known in this place. He is artful and may procure or forge a pass as he can write-he is about 22 years old, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, of slim make and thin visage, an African by birth; speaks badly: from his appearance and dialect might be taken by some for a French negro-dresses well, and may have money about him, having acted for some as a barber, shoe cleaner &c. without leave. It is possible he may be harboured in this place, or enticed from it: if so, on proof to conviction of the parties and delivery of the fellow an additional reward of $15 will be paid with reasonable charges. If he should return voluntarily in a few days, as 'tis his first offence, he will be forgiven.<BR>J. MARTIN.<BR>Dec. 27, 1816.
