Transcript: <BR>Chowan County, Sept. 5.<BR>RUN away from the subscriber the 31st of August last, a mulatto fellow named Jack, 25 years old, about 5 feet 7 inches high, well set, a blacksmith by trade, carried away with him sundry clothes amongst which I recollect to have seen him have a striped silk jacket. Whoever delivers the said slave to me, near Edenton, or secures him in any gaol so that I get him, shall have, if taken in this county, 30 dollars reward, if out of the county, 50 dollars and be entitled to what money he has with him when taken, which (I am informed) is considerable. I do hereby forewarn all persons from carrying the said slave out of the country.<BR>JOHN BAP. BEASLEY.
