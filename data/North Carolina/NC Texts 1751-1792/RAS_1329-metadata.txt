Transcript: Thirty (Silver) Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN AWAY on the 3d inst. from the subscriber, a Negro Man, named TONEY, about five feet eight or nine inches high, his breast a good deal projected, a very likely active fellow, about 25 years of age; has been whipped (before I had him) consequently his back much marked; he is as black as most negroes, drinks hard. By information he was seen at the Grant Swamp, passing as a freeman, having procured from some villain a free pass to protect him, and said he intended to ship himself on board the first vessel going out of the country. He had on and carried with him a white negro cotton coat and breeches, a short blue cloth coat and black breeches, common negro shoes and stockings, oznaburgh shirts, and a cocked hat. The above reward will be given to any person that delivers the said negro to me if taken out of the counties of Norfolk or Princess Ann, or half the sum if taken in either of them, or the same sum if secured in any gaol so that I get him. All masters of vessels and others are forbid employing or carrying him off.<BR>DENNIS DAWLEY.<BR>Virginia, Princess Ann[e], Jan. 17.    0 3
