Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>Ran-away from the subscriber, the 15th day of May last.<BR>A Likely Negro-Fellow, named SCRUB, about twenty-five years old, well made, of a middle stature, a good countenance, has scarcely any beard, rather of a black complexion, very sensible, strong and active; he is a pretty good groom, having taken care of a stud horse for several years past: He carried with him a good deal of cloathing, mostly home-spun, and I believe about fifteen or twenty pounds hard money. I have owned him for 13 years past, and always found him remarkable honest and of good behavior; he is a tolerable good gardener and waggoner, and will probably endeavour to be employed as the latter, or as a hostler: I expect he will attempt to get to Norfolk (where he was raised), and pass as a free man by the name of Charles Thompson, or Charles Fry; and as he has great notions of freedom it is very probably he will try to make his escape by sea. All persons are cautioned from taking him out of the country. The above reward will be given and reasonable expences to any person who will bring him to me, or fifteen dollars to have him secured in any goal in this state or Virginia, so that I get him again.<BR> RICHARD BENNEHAM.<BR> Orange County, August, 1784.
