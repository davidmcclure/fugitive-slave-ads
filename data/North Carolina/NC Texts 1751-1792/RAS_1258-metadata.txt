Transcript: FIVE POUNDS REWARD. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Iredell county, North Carolina, on the first day of July last,a negro fellow named FRANK: he is of a yellow complexion, shews [sic] some marks of the small pox, is about 5 feet 8 inches high; has by running away before, and getting frost bitten, lost two of the little toes of his left foot, and part of the third one; I expect he will change his cloaths and name, and pass for a free man as he has done before, and endeavour to make his way to Fayetteville or Wilmington, and get on board some vessel, as he has often threatened so to do. Captains of vessels and others are cautioned on their peril not to harbour said fellow. Any person who will take up said fellow and bring him to me, or secure him so that I get him again, shall receive the above reward, and all reasonable charges. <BR> October 18, 1790.<BR>JOHN WORK.
