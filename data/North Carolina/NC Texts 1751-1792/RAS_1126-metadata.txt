Scott at Washington, a Negro man named John, about 25 years of age, about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, thin visage, smooth face, lips thin for a negro, nose rather prominent than flat, speaks slow and good English, and when speaking looks you full in the face--had on when he went away, a ticklenburgh shirt and trowsers, shoes and buckles, and had with him a large blue seaman's jacket lined, patches on the elbows to prevent its wearing thro' a small round hat; he has been bred to the sea, and says he was born in London and pretends to be free.  It is probable he will ship on board some vessel and endeavour to make his escape, all masters of vessels are therefore forewarned from carrying him ot of the country. The above reward with reasonable charges, will be paid for apprehending and securing him so that he may be got again.<BR>THO.[THOMAS] W. PEARSON.<BR>Newbern, June 27, 1790.
