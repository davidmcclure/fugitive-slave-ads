Transcript: FIVE POUNDS REWARD.<BR>RUN AWAY from the subscriber on Sunday the 20th instant, two negro men, named LUKE and JACK, both Coopers and Sawyers--LUKE is a yellow fellow about 25 years of age, five feet ten inches high, with a small gap between his fore teeth, had on when he went away, a white double wove yarn country cloth coat and breeches, a new felt hat, blue or white yarn stockings and old shoes.-- JACK is 25 years old, six feet high, has remarkable large feet and hands, and one of his upper fore teeth is much decayed, he had on when he went away an old serge coat, double wove dyed yarn country cloth breeches, a new felt hat, and old shoes, but had other clothes with him and it is probable that he will occasionally change his dress. The above deserted negroes will probably endeavour to pass for free men, and I am apprehensive they will seek an opportunity to ship themselves on board some vessel.-- Any person who will deliver the said negroes to me in Edgecombe County, 18 miles above Tarborough, or confine them in any gaol so that I may get them again, shall be entitled to the above reward, or more if that sum should not be deemed sufficient compensation.<BR>EXUM PHILIPS<BR>Edgecomb County, March 27, 1791.    75 4
