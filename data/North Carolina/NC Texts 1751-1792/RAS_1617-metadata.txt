Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>  FROM the subscriber, living in Cumberland county, at the lower Little-River Bridge, on the new road, an old negro fellow, named.<BR>ROGER<BR>He has thick lips, a little stoop shouldered, and grey headed--has high veins in his arms and legs, and in his legs the veins appear to be knots--his back shews [spic] a few marks of the switch--he is lively and resolute at any thing he undertakes. I expect his intention was to go to some of the back counties, and endeavour to pass for a free man, as he was once sufferred to pass as such in some of the those counties, where he took up with a free woman for his wife, who I have now living at my house.  Any person who will deliver the said negro to me, shall receive five pounds reward, and I will pay all reasonable charges.<BR>JAMES CAMPBELL.<BR> May 13, 1790.
