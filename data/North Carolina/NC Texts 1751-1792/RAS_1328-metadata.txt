Transcript: Ten Pounds Specie, Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living at Lunenburg Court-House (Virginia) the 9th of November last, a Negro fellow, a blacksmith by trade; about five feet six or seven inches high, about twenty-four years of age. He stole a bay mare, about five years old last spring, about four feet seven inches high, her off hind food white near the footlock, with some black spots in the white.<BR>He carried off sundry cloaths, viz. a green broad cloth coat, a white ditto, spotted all over, a pair of shoe-boots, a pair of silver spurs and silver shoe-buckles, a corded rib waistcoat and breeches. He has a very smiling countenance, his name HARRY, though I expect he will change it, and pass for a free man, as it supposed that a certain Charles Burks, now in Amelia gaol, has given him a pass.<BR>I will give the above reward to any person who will secure the said fellow so that I get him again.<BR>JOSEPH SMITH.
