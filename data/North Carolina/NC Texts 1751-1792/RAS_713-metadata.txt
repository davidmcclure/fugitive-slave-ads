Transcript: Twenty Pounds Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, in Dobbs county, North Carolina, on the 22d of May last, a Negro man named BEN; he is a very likely well made fellow, very active, about six feet high, of a yellow complexion, shows the marks of the small-pox very plainly, has, by some accident, lost a small part of one of his ears, his great toe, I believe on the right foot, turns back inwardly. He is an excellent waiter, understands the care of horses, and waggoning, and is a remarkable good ploughman. He took with him a variety of cloaths, and occasionally dresses very neat. It is expected he will pass for a free man, and privately leave the state.<BR>Whoever will apprehend said slave, and secure him so that I get him again, shall receive the above reward, with all reasonable expences.<BR>BENJAMIN SHEPPERD.<BR>June 25, 1789.
