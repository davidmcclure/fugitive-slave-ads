Transcript: RUN AWAY from Mount Pleasant estate, on the North-West, a Negro fellow named TONY, late the property of Miss Cobham, well known in and about Wilmington, as he was one of the fiddlers to the assemblies. He is tall, well made, and thin vissaged, between black and yellow. He took away a fiddle, some carpenters tools, & c. He has a wife at Mr. Frederick Jone's, on the Sound, named Belly, (his cook) who harboured him when he left his master before.
