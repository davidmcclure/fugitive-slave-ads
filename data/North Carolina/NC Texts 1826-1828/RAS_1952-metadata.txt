Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, on the 9th May, 1827, a negro man named GEORGE, about five feet ten inches high, about a middle complexion, between the dark and yellow, stout, square built, and very active, about 34 years of age, very quick and bold spoken, short kincky[sic] hair, and small ears, and has three scars, one on his back, cut with an axe, lengthways, by a fall, one on his leg, another on the top of his foot. He conveyed off several suits of clothes, among them, one very notable deep blue broad cloth coat, which fits very loosely. I expect he will attempt to pass as a free man. The above reward will be given to any person that will deliver said negro to me, or confine him in jail, so that I get him. The subscriber lives 8 miles above Raleigh, on the Hillsborough road.<BR>JONATHAN STEPHENSON.<BR>May 9.<BR>20-t1
