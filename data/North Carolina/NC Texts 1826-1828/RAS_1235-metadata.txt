Transcript: Five Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, on the night of the 5th instant, a negro woman, named NANCY. She is about 19 or 20 years of age, some smaller than the common size of her age--weighs, perhaps, about 125 or 130: she is of a dark mulatto complexion; has a round face, flat nose and short hair. The articles of clothing she took with her, are a dark striped calico bonnet; one white striped muslin, one deep blue, one green calico, one checked northern homespun, and one striped copperas colour homespun frock; one pair of shoetees, right and left, half worn, and one pair of morocco shoes. She was purchased of Samuel Davenport, Esq. of Washington county in this State, and it is probable she is making her way to his neighborhood. The above reward and all reasonable expenses will be given for her delivery to the subscriber in this city, or confinement in any jail so that he can get her again.<BR>R. TUCKER.<BR>Raleigh, April 9, 1828<BR>15-tf
