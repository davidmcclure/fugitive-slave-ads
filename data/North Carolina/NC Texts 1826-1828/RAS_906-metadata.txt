Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber in February last, a tall negro man by the name of WILLIS, about thrity-five years of age; he is rather slim built and thin visage; has a down look, speaks slow, and would be very easily confused if strictly interrogated. No particular marks recollected, by which he could be described. It is probable he has obtained a free pass by some means or other, and may be in the employment of some person under a pretense of being free. He has some relations on the Hickory Mountain, in this county; he was very intimate in the family of Peter Chava (a free man of colour,) who has left this county, and is now living in or near the Hawfields, Orange county, and also with the Carters' free persons of colour, who now live in Guilford county; he also had some connexion with the Hathcocks, who ran away from Chatham a year or two since, and are now living in Davidson county. I have good reason to believe the Hathcocks, Carters, or Chavas would harbour him, and render any assistance in their power. The above reward will be given to any person or persons who will apprehend and confine in Jail the said fellow, so that I get him again; and all other reasonable expenses paid, if delivered to me to Chatham county, on New-Hope.<BR>THOS.[Thomas] BELL, Sen.<BR>May 23, 1827<BR>22-6w.
