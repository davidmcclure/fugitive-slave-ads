Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>I WILL give the above reward of twenty-five dollars, for apprehending and securing in jail, or otherwise, negro Isaac, so that I get him again; and will pay all necessary expences[sic] if delivered to me at my place of residence, in the county of Edgecombe, about two miles east of the stage road leading from Tarborough to Enfield, and about eight miles from the latter. Isaac is a bright mulatto; sprightly, possessing much impudence, has a bushy head, and well proportioned in his form; his size I am not prepared to say, not having seen him for near twelve months--his age I imagine about twenty. This negro, I understand, absconded on Monday 14th inst. from Dr. Landon Clanton, of the town of Halifax, to whom he was hired for the present year. It is highly probable, that this boy has obtained a fraudulent pass, and will endeavor to pass for a freeman; a circumstance which goes to support such a conclusion is, I am informed he went off with a free man of color, named Napoleon Cabarrus, who resides in or about Edenton, N.C. and that they have been seen together beyond Pollock's ferry, on Roanoke. Masters of vessels and all others are hereby cautioned against harboring or carrying off said negro Issac[sic] at their peril.<BR>ELI B. WHITAKER,<BR>Edgecombe Co.N.C.}<BR>Trustee, &c.<BR>Aug. 28, 1826.}<BR>2-3
