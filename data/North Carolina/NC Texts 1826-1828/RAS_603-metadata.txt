Transcript: Twenty-Five Dollars Reward<BR>WILL be given for securing in any Jail in this State, so that I can get him, my runaway slave Robin, who left me some time about the first of March last.  Robin is about twenty-eight years old; though a negro, is of a tolerably light complexion; about five feet ten inches high; rather spare made, he is a fellow of good sense, and speaks quick when spoken to, and has a good countenance; he will try, it is thought, to pass himself as a free man; as he has already called himself, and passed by the name of Robert Whitfield.  He is left-handed, and has a defective finger on one hand, which is not recollected.  He will say he is a carpenter, and he can do, and has done, something at that trade.  He has a very long prominent chin, and large mouth and excellent teeth, which shows plain when he is talking, he can read very well for a negro. Robin will likely try to get to Sloop Point, near Wilmington, to the Plantation of Lewis Whitfield, where he has a wife.  I will give the above reward for his confinement so that I get him, & if delivered to me in Smithfield, Johnston c'ty[county], N.C. will pay all reasonable expenses.<BR>BYTHON BRYAN.<BR>Nov. 9th, 1826.    21aw4w<BR>The Wilmington Herald will insert the above 4 times and forward the account to Smithfield.
