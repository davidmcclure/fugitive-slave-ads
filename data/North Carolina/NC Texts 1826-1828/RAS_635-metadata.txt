Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, living in the county of Guilford, a mulatto man slave, by the name of KIT. He is about five feet eight inches high, well made and straight--hair somewhat grey, is between 35 and 40 years of age, is a bright mulatto, and is ruptured. There are no marks about him, which are recollected. He wore an iron truss when he absconded. I expect he will aim for Fayetteville. He ran away once before, and was taken from the jail of that place. He is well known about Fayetteville, where he called himself John White, or William Wright. For his apprehension and confinement in jail, so that I get him again, I will give a reward of twenty dollars.<BR>ROBERT GILCHRIST.<BR>Guilford cty, N.C. Oct. 8, 1827.--78t80P[?]<BR>The Wilmington Herald will publish this three times and send their account to this office for payment.
