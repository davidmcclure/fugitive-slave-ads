Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>WILL be given for negro women FLORA and CHOLOE. Flora is the daughter of Mrs. Gardener's Aggy, and sister to a fellow in Edenton called Peter King. She is slender, raw boned ugly negro, and is well known in Edenton to be as bad as she is ugly-she is not very black. Chloe is black, tall and likely, Gen. McDonald's Mose is her husband and his man London is her father. She has a sister at General Richard Brownrigg's, and must have a young child, perhaps not more than a month old, though it is likely she has given it to some of her friends to take care of.<BR>I will give 20 DOLLARS for each of either of them, delivered to me or secured in jail, so that I get them and pay all reasonable expences.<BR>JOHN LANSTON.
