Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber on the twentieth of last month, (June,) a negro woman, by the name of JUDA, about twenty-two years of age. She is rather slim built, small breast, speaks and looks very fierce when spoken to, takes considerable pains with her hair, and was somewhat yellow complected. It is expected that she is lurking about Raleigh, or in Buffalo District, in this county, or perhaps on White Oak or New Hope Creeks, in Chatham, as she or her husbands has relations in those neighborhoods. I will give a reward of ten dollars, with much thanks, to any person who will apprehend and confine her in Raleigh jail, or deliver her to my house, sixteen miles south west of Raleigh.<BR>GRAY B. BARKER.<BR>July 4, 1827.<BR>23[?]-tf
