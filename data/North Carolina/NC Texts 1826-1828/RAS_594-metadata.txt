Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN away in July last MARTIN, a Negro Man purchased at the sale of Dr. Helme in Smithfield.  This negro, as I believed, I had sold to Mr. Wm.[William] Boylan, and it has not until this day, been determined otherwise.  As Martin run away under the impression of his being sold to Mr. Boylan, and as he had no objections to live with him, if he returns in one month from this time, he shall be received and pardoned and I will put him on my Westbrook Farm in Johnston county, near to where his wife lives.  Should he not come in, within the time specified, the above reward will be given for his apprehension and delivery to me in Raleigh.<BR>WILLIAM POLK.<BR>June 15, 1827.    wtf-73.
