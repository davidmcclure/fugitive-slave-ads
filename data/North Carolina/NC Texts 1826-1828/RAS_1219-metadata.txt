Transcript: FIVE DOLLARS REWARD. <BR> RAN away from the subscriber, on Wednesday last, a Negro Woman named Easter, aged about 26, rather chunky built, very black, with thick lips, talks fast, and tolerably bold in her looks: she had a cooperas[sic] color and white striped cotton frock, a plain cotton, and a blue and white calico frock: and she has an old plain woollen man's roundabout, more than half worn, which she sometimes wears: and it is possible she may have a free pass: she is pregnant, which may be easily discovered. It is expected she has gown towards Tennessee, or possibly towards Granville county, where she came from. The above reward will be given for her delivery to me, near Salisbury, Rowan county, N.C. or information where she may be had. <BR> HENRY SWINK.<BR> February 9th, 1828. 01
