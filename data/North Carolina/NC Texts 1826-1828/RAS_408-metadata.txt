Transcript: $50 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, living in the county of Edgecombe, N.C. about eight miles north of Tarborough, on the 24th of August last, a negro fellow named WASHINGTON, about 21 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, dark complexion, stout built, and an excellent field hand--no particular marks about him recollected. The said fellow was formerly owned by Mr. Jas.[James] Taylor, of Martin county, and I think it more than probable that he is now lurking in the neighborhood of Taylor's Ferry. The above reward of Fifty Dollars, will be given to any person who will apprehend said negro and deliver him to me again. All persons are hereby forbid harboring or employing said fellow under penalty of the law.<BR>JOHN LAWRENCE.<BR>Oct. 4, 1827.<BR>7-3
