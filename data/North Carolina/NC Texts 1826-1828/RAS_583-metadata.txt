Transcript: Twenty-Five Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from my premises sometime in September last, a my negro man ISAAC--about thirty years of age, of middle stature, spare made, with some marks of the whip on his back.  He can read a little, has some knowledge of figures and the carpenters trade, and has a downcast look when spoken to.  He had on when he went off a blue cloth coat, olive coloured pantaloons, and a Castor hat.--I expect he will try to pass for a free man, and get to a non-slave-holding state, as he has for four or five years back had an ""itching"" that way.<BR>Master of Vessels and others are hereby forwarned against harbouring or carrying off said fellow.  I will give the above reward for his delivery to me, or confinement in any jail, or for information so that I get him again--and will pay all reasonable expenses besides.<BR>NATHAN B. WHITFIELD.<BR>Rockford, Lenoir County, N.C<BR>Oct. 29th, 1826--50tf<BR>The Raleigh Register and Wilmington Herald will give the above four insertions, and forward their accounts to this office for payment.
