Transcript: Ranaway<BR>From the subscriber on the 6th inst. a Negro Man by the name of MARTING, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, yellow complection, about 26 years of age.  He carried away with him, a large bundle of home made clothes; has a noted scar on his forehead.  I expect he will attempt to pass by the name of JAMES DAY, with a pass for that purpose.  I will give a reasonable reward to any person apprehending said negro, so that I get him.<BR>JOSHUA BANNER.<BR>Germanton, Oct. 8.    8 3w
