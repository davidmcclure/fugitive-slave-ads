Transcript: Ranaway<BR>FROM the subscriber, living about 12 miles east of Raleigh, on the road leading from Rogers' Cross Roads to Smithfield, his Negro Man, named AARON.  Aaron is about forty years of age, quite a knowing, polite fellow, dark complexion, and from a fall received from a horse by which his leg was injured, he limps when walking.  He has a remarkable scar over his right eye, occasioned by a blow from a rock during a fight.  He took with him a mixed homespun body coat, a drap great coat, and a pair of pantaloons dyed with copperas--none of his other clothing recollected.  It is expected he will endeavor to make his way to Virginia, whence he was originally brought.  Probably he is lurking about Petersburg; or he may go to Richmond county in this State, as he has a wife there.<BR>The subscriber will give a reward of $10 for his apprehension, if taken in the State, or $20 if out of the limits, besides paying all necessary expenses in bringing him home.<BR>WILLIAM B. FOWLER.<BR>Wake county, April 2.    53 tf
