Transcript: One Hundred Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, sometime in September last, four Negro Men, viz.-- ISAAC, SCIPIO, JERRY, and KASEY<BR>ISAAC is about thirty years of age, of middle stature, spare made, with some marks of the whip upon his back.  He can read a little, has some knowledge of figures and the carpenter's trade, & has a downcast look when spoken to.  He had on when he went off a blue cloth coat, olive colored pantaloons, and a Castor hat.<BR>SCIPIO is about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, spare made, and about the same age of Isaac.<BR>JERRY is a stout fellow, about 6 feet high, and 26 or 27 years of age, and has a sulky look.<BR>KASEY is about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, very stout, between 45 and 50 years of age, and limps a little in walking, caused by having his thigh broken.<BR>I expect they are endeavoring to get northwardly to some non slaveholding State, as Isaac for some time had a disposition that way, and no doubt has enticed the rest away with him.  I expect they were all in company with another of my negro men, who went off at the same time, and who has since been lodged in Granville Jail.<BR>Masters of Vessels and other are hereby forwarned against harboring or carrying off said fellows.  I will give the above reward for their delivery to me, or confinement in any jail, or for information so that I get thim[them] again--or Twenty-Five dollars for any one of them.<BR>NATHAN B. WHITFIELD<BR>Rockford, Lenoir County,} November 15th, 1826} 12 tf.
