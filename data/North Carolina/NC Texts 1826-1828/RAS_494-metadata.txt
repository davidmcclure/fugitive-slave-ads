Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, about fifteen months since, a negro woman, named TAMAR.  She is about 22 or 23 years old, yellow complected, stout built and has a scar on the left rist[sic]. I purchased her from Jno.[Jonathan] A.

I will give the above reward to any person who will apprehend her and secure her in Jail, so that I get her again.<BR>PEYTON HIGH.<BR>Wake county, 12 miles above Raleigh, August 22, 1826.}35-tf
