Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN away from the subscriber, on the 12th inst. (yesterday) two negro men, EDMUND and KING. Edmund is a small fellow, about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, of a rather yellow complexion, a little bow legged, and about 35 years of age. This fellow I purchased of Gen.[General] Bethel, four of five years ago. King is also a small fellow, rather taller than Edmund, quite black, with a scar on some part of his face. He is about 25 years of age, and was formerly owned by Mr. James Morrison, of Rocky River. They took with them clothing of different descriptions, so that it is unnecessary to describe those they wore away. I will give Twenty Dollars reward for apprehending the said fellow; or Ten Dollars for either (provided they are delivered to me, on Sugar Creek, nine miles south of Charlotte,) exclusive of all travelling expences; or for committing them to jail, anywhere within this State, so that I get them again.<BR>STEPHEN FOX.<BR>September 13, 1827.  3t82
