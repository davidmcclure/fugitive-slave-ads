Transcript: 35 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 5th instant, his negro man, named ELLIS. Ellis is 19 or 20 years of age, 5 feet 6 or 8 inches high, stout, well made, and a little inclined to be bow legged; has very bushy hair, especially before and speaks tolerably quick.<BR>He took with him a blue broad cloth coat, about half worn, with gilt buttons, with these words on the under part, 'W. Wallis, treble Orange;' a vest of the same cloth as the coat, with buttons covered with the same; a short jacket and pantaloons filled with wool; a shirt and pantaloons of white northern homespun; a shot gun with full stock, shivered at the muzzle, with the fore thimble off. The gun has the second lock to her; carried also, a new black Hat, rather small for him, with Lafayette's name in it. Is a tolerable shoemaker, carried a shoe knife and some other shoemaker's tools; he can spell a little, and I think will attempt to pass as a free fellow, and in all probability will aim for the non-slave holding states.<BR>Ellis was raised in Montgomery county, N.C. by Mr. Wyatt Randall.<BR>Any person who will apprehend said negro and bring him to me, two miles above Sneedsborough, Anson county, N.C. shall receive the above reward; or 20 Dollars, if confined in any jail so that I get him.<BR>Address the subscriber at Morven Post Office, Anson county, N.C.<BR>DANIEL COOK.<BR>Cheraw, Nov. 9, 1826.--3t'10.
