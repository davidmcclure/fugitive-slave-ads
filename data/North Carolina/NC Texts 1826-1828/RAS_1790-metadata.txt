Transcript: Stop him! Stop him!<BR>Ran away (from Stephen Wallis, on Lime Stone, who had him hired,) on the night of the 28th ult. a negro man named JOE, about 35 years old, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, stout built, a little inclined to be yellow and fleshy, a quick spoken, saucy, impudent fellow. From information since his departure, I expect he is following his wife to the Southern States, who was carried off in company of John Rhodes and his mother, a widow, and four of his small brothers, with 2 carts, a single horse in each, one of them a bay, with a blaze face; the other a sorrel. The widow rode a chair drawn by a white mare. They had in company a wench and three small children, besides Joe's wife, who is quite young, very small and yellow. It is hoped that such a family on the road will be noticed, and the fellow, if with them, thrown into prison. I will give a reward of ten dollars for his confinement in jail in this State, and twenty dollars if out of the State, and if brought home all reasonable expenses will be paid. He belongs to the heirs of Archelaus Pipkin, of whom I am guardian.<BR>CHARLES A. HINES.<BR>Duplin county, N.C.}<BR>7th March, 1828.}<BR>13-3t<BR>The Editors of the Columbia Telescope and Milledgeville Journal will insert the above three times, and forward their accounts to this office.
