Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the second of January last, a bright Mulatto man named ANTHONY, 23 years of age, 5 feet 6 or 8 inches high.  He has the sign of a burn on his hand which may easily be discovered by an examination.  I expect he is making his way to some non slave holding State, probably Ohio.  A horse was missing in the neighbourhood about three weeks since, which I expect was stolen by said negro: the horse is a chesnut sorrel 14 hands, 1 inch high, with a blaze in his face, three of his feet white.  The above reward will be given for his apprehension and deliver to me in Chatham county, 25 miles west of Pittsborough, or securing him in any jail so that I can get him, and all reasonable expenses paid.  Ten dollars will be paid for the delivery of the horse alone.<BR>JOHN BROOKS.<BR>Chatham county, Sept. 21, 1826    90<BR>The Fayetteville Observer and National Intelligencer, will each insert the above once a week, for three weeks, and forward their accounts to Winship Stedman, Esq. Postmaster at Pittsboro' for payment.
