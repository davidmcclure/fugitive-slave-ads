Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber in Warren county, two negro men--FERRY and FED. Ferry was sold some time in the month of January last, in the town of Warrenton, by the executors of Col. Joseph Hawkins, dec'd[deceased], and I became the purchaser; since which time he has not made his appearance to me. I am induced to believe he went off from a belief that I was about to sell him to a gentleman from Mecklenburg, Virginia, who made an offer for him the next day after I purchased him. Ferry is about 27 years of age, black complected, and is a Black Smith by trade, and has been living for several years past upon Col. Hawkin's plantation upon Swift Creek, in Wake cty. [county] where probably he is now gone. I hired Fed from the estate of Col. Hawkins in January last.--He is about 32 years of age, also black, and wears his beard generally very long, and has been living for several years past upon Col. Hawkin's plantation in Chatham county, 4 miles below Haywood. I will give the above reward to any person who will apprehend the abovementioned negroes and lodge them in some jail so that I get them again, or $10 for either.<BR>M. T. HAWKINS.<BR>Warren county, Feb.}<BR>28, 1828.}<BR>10-tf
