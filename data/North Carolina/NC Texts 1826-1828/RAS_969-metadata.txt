Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber on the 23d February last, my negro slave ATTA, aged 32 years, about six feet high, trim built, a good countenance with a long forehead sloping back; he has a mother's mark on one side of his lower lip--not, however, to be noticed but on close examination, the skin appearing lighter or of a more yellow cast than the rest; his feet is different from the generality of negroes, the instep being high and hollow under, his big and little toes are in a small degree larger than the ordinary proportion to the other toes.  His complexion is smooth and black.<BR>From suspicious circumstances, it is supposed there was an intrigue between him and a white girl of the neighborhood, who since his departure, has eloped from her father's house and has not since been heard of.  It is supposed they aim at getting to some place where they may live in the habits of the relationship of man and wife unmolested.  Should such be their intention, it is probable he will attempt to pass either with a free pass, or as the servant of said girl.  She is rather tall and slim; her features not pleasant; eyes blue; nose rather short, and face rather narrow and freckled; she went off with a sun bonnet, homespun striped and checked dress.<BR>It is expected that the above negro will alter his name and not own to it, except before some person acquainted with him.<BR>Any person who will safely secure said negro in jail or otherwise, so that I get him safely again, will receive the above reward and all reasonable expenses paid, on application to me at Randall's P.O. Roberson county, N.C.<BR>NEIL BROWN.<BR>April 2d, 1827.    5t62p<BR>N.B. Any information respecting the above persons, directed to the Post Office at Randalsville, Roberson county, N.C. will confer a great favor on the subscriber, as also oblige the respectable friends of the unfortunate girl.
