Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward. <BR> RANAWAY, on Tuesday the 14th instant, a negro man named RICHARD, about 25 years of age, five feet, eight or ten inches high; yellow complexion; he has on his left hand or wrist, so well as I recollect, a tolerably large scar, nearly in the form of a C. He is stout and well built, had on when he left me a green velvet short coat, a pair of pantaloons made of blue casanett, and a high crowned hat. It is probable he may make towards Washington City, as I purchased him from Josiah Huie, who brought him from that section of the country last spring. <BR>The above reward will be given for him if lodged in any jail in the United States, so that I get him again. <BR>JOSEPH [illegible] M'KINLEY. <BR> Cabarrus County, N.C.<BR>[illegible] 15, 1826. 37tf
