Transcript: $10 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, living 3 miles south of Mount Prospect, N.C. on the 13th August last, negro LUKE, about 50 years old, 6 feet high, and dark complexion. It is deemed unnecessary to give a further description of him, as he is well known in Halifax and Edgecombe counties, as a house carpenter and millwright. Luke is supposed to be lurking in the neighborhood of Wm.[William] Sturdivant, near Hill's Bridge, in Halifax county, where he has a wife; or, in the neighborhood of Mrs. Elizabeth Porter, in this county, where he formerly lived. I have also understood that he has been in the habit of visiting the upper part of Halifax county, near Blake Baker's. He has recently been seen in this county, with a broadax, and then said he was in search of work. The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver said negro to me, or confine him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>EDWIN L. MOORE.<BR>Sept. 13, 1827.<BR>4-3
