Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, on Saturday the 2nd of this inst. my negro man HARRY, about 40 years of age, 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high; he is a thick well set fellow, round full face, speaks quick when spoken to, but when scared is apt to stutter, about as common, walks stooping, his back considerably marked by the lash, and a hatter by trade. It is likely said fellow may have a free pass, as I understand and have reason to believe he intends leaving the State in company with a man by the name of Ward, who has likely escaped from the prison of Bertie county, where he had been confined for some time. They will no doubt make their way to the Western Country, or to Norfolk, in Virginia, to take shipping. The above reward will be given for the delivery or confinement of said negro, so that I get him again. If taken up out of the State, I will give a reward of thirty dollars, and pay all reasonable expenses. Masters of vessels and others are forbid harbouring, employing or carrying said fellow off, under the penalty of the law.<BR>CHARLTON LEARY.<BR>Colerain, Bertie county, N. C.}<BR>June 11, 1827.}<BR>26-tf
