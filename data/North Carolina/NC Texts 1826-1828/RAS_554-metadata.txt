Transcript: 20 DOLLS.[DOLLARS] REWARD. <BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the night of the 22nd inst. a bright mulatto boy named BEN--said boy is in his twentieth year, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high; stout built; has a brisk walk; and a scar on his thumb. I have no doubt this fellow will endeavor to pass for a free man, and perhaps may have a forged pass. He has on when he went away a pair of yellow yarn pantaloons an old black bombazet coat and black wool hat. I will give the above reward for the delivery of said boy to me at my residence or fifteen dollars to have him secured in any jail so that I get him again. <BR>EDWARD WILKSON. <BR>On Shoe Heel, 6 miles from Laurel Hill, Richmond C'ty, N.C. <BR>August 25th, 1827.--68tf
