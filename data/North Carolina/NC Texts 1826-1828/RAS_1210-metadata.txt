Transcript: Notice.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, about the first day of Sept. last, a negro man, named JACK, who it is likely will change his name to that of JOHN or REDICK. Jack is about 20 or 21 years of age, of common size, stout built, yellow complected, & had a crippled hand by a burn (his left hand.) His clothing not recollected, but principally homespun. It is supposed Jack is aiming to go to Gates county, N.C. or Norfolk, in Virginia, where he was raised. He also has brothers in Columbia, S.Ca, where he may probably go. Any person who will deliver Jack to me, in Mecklenburg county, at my house, 10 miles south of Charlotte, shall be suitably rewarded.<BR>SAMUEL REID.<BR>Oct. 17, 1826<BR>44-3tp
