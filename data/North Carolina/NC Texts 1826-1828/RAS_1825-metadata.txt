Transcript: Take up the Run-away, Negro JACK<BR>RAN away from the subscriber sometime in January last, a mulatto negro fellow, about six feet two inches high, twenty-two or three years of age, long, full face, rather a down look, would weigh about two hundred pounds; had on when he went away an old furred black hat, a little torn on the brim, a blue broadcloth coat with a velvet collar, pantaloons of casinet, dove colour; has other cloths[clothes] not recollected.  He is the negro fellow Jack that formerly belonged to William H. Whitted, and was sold after the death of said Whitted by his executor; it is probable that he may be lurking about Hillsborough, N.C. where he was raised, and has a pretended wife there and many relations.  Ten dollars reward will be given for his apprehension and delivery to me, or if lodged in any jail so that I may get him again; and if brought to me, all resonable expenses will be paid. And whereas the said negro Jack has left me without the slightest provocation, I request all persons who may see him to take him dead or alive.  If he should be killed in apprehending, I do and will acquit the person so doing from any liability to me whatever.<BR>Jefferson Homer.<BR>Red-Mountain, Orange county, N.C.<BR>16 miles N.E. of Hillsborough.<BR>Feb 21.  20--3wp
