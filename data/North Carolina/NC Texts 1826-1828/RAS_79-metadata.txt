Transcript: Ran away<BR>From the subscriber, living in the vicinity of Raleigh, on the 1st inst. a negro man named BEN--generally called Ben Taylor. Ben is about 22 years of age, 4 feet 3 or 4 inches high, brown complexion, stout and well made, and is a brisk and sensible fellow; and it is probable he will use every device to prevent detection. I will give a reward of ten dollars for his apprehension and confinement in any jail, so that I get him again, or for his delivery at my house, about one mile from the city of Raleigh, and pay all reasonable expenses.<BR>JOHN SUGG.<BR>October 9, 1827<BR>42-tf
