Transcript: Ranaway<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 12th July last, my negro Woman ROSE, about 40 years of age, 5 feet high, spare built, yellow complexion. She carried off with her a variety of clothing, among which is a black bomazette frock.  I am induced to believe that she is harbored about Raleigh or its vicinity.  I will give Five Dollars reward for her apprehension, so that I get her again.<BR>THOS.[THOMAS] G. WHITAKER<BR>August 2.    89 3t
