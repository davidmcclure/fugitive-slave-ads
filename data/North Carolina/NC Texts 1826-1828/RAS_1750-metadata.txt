Transcript: Runaway.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on Wednesday, the 11th day of October last, a negro man named CHARLRS[sic], eighteen years old, yellow complected, slim made, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, and when spoken to, looks wild, and his voice is rather effeminate. The boy says he was raised in the state of Virginia, Prince George county. Any person who will apprehend said negro and confine him in any jail, and give me information so that I get him, shall receive a generous reward.<BR>JOHN SLOAN.<BR>Charlotte, Nov. 6, 1826.--106tf
