Transcript: 
Runaways,<BR>MOSES, NAT & HARRIS.<BR>FIFTY DOLLARS Reward for Moses, TWENTY-FIVE Dollars each for Nat and Harris. Said negroes ran away about the 15th instant, and are supposed to be lurking in Occoniechy[sic] Neck. Moses has a wife at Wm. [William] Long's plantation in Northampton county, four or five miles from Halifax town. I am somewhat of opinion that they have gone to Southampton county, Va. they have some near relations belonging to the Mr. Ricks', in Southampton. I am confident that Moses enticed Nat and Harris off. Moses is about 27 years old, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high--Nat is 21 years old, and Harris 17 years old--all of them near one height and one weight, that is, about 140 or 150. They are brothers, and of a bright complexion for negroes--no mark that I can recollect.<BR>ISAAC RICKS.<BR>Halifax county, Jan. 27, 1827.
