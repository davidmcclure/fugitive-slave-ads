Transcript: 10 Dollars Reward.<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension of my Negro Man<BR>JERRY,<BR>who absconded from my service the 22d of April last. He is about 22 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches high, dark complexion, and sharp face. When standing his knees bend backwards, and when spoken to is apt to stammer. It is very likely he is lurking in or about Edenton, a place more noted, than any in the state, for the concealing and harboring of runaways. The above reward will given to any one who will deliver him to me, or secure him in jail so that I get him.<BR>BAKER HOSKINS<BR>May 7th, 1827.
