Transcript: Fifteen Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, residing in Onslow County, on the 24th ult. a likely negro woman named CARRY.  She is about 22 years of age, and has a large scar on one of her thighs, occasioned from a burn.  She ranaway with her child.  I understand that she passes as a free woman, and I suspect she is about Newbern, among her relations, who belong to the estate of the late Daniel Shackelford, or that she has harboured among the free negroes.<BR>The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver said negro to the subscriber, or secure her in any jail so that I get her.<BR>B. HOUSE.<BR>Onslow County, Jan. 23, 1827.
