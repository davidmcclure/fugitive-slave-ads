Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 3d instant, in Caswell County, on the road leading from Richmond to the South, a Negro Fellow by the name of Lewis, aged about 21 years, about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high, rather a round close made heavy set fellow, about a copper colour and very likely; had on when he left me, a roundabout coat of double wove homespun, and pantaloons of the same, and a pair of bangup cord pantaloons, and a white knit shirt, and some other clothing not recollected.  I purchased this fellow recently in Richmond, of a Mr. Randolph W. Roper, agent for J.T. James.  Mr. Roper told me, this fellow was raised by his father near Williamsburg, James City County, Va. towards which place, Petersburg or Richmond, it is likely he will aim for.  I forwarn all masters of vessels from taking him on board, and them and all others from employing him in any way whatever.  I will give the above reward for his apprehension and confinement in any jail so that I get him again. Should the above Negro be taken up, I wish information given to Mr. Nicholas Thompson, Leasburg, Caswell County, North-Carolina.<BR>PETER WIER.<BR>February 10th, 1827.<BR>The Pet. Intelligencer will insert the above and forward their accounts to this office.
