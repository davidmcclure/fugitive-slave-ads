Transcript: RUN-AWAY from the subscriber about 8 days past, a negro fellow about twenty five years of age; he is short, well set, and active; not very black, and works very well at the Blacksmith's trade. This fellow was raised in Newbern, and formerly belonged to Abner Nash, Esq.--It is supposed he is gone to Newbern to get on board some vessel--He has two brothers, ABRAM and TOM, who live in Newbern, and who, I suppose will keep him secreted until he can get off. If this fellow is not yet got to Newbern, he is about Mrs. Haslen's Mills' near West's Ferry. For apprehending and securing the said fellow, so that I get him again, I will pay all reasonable charges, gaol fees, &c. A fellow by the name of ROBIN, a sawyer, of light colour, the property of Mr. Garrot Goodlow, of Franklin county, went off with my fellow, and I doubt not Mr. Goodlow will give an equal reward for him.<BR>WILLIAM NASH.<BR>Caswell county, July 17th, 1797.
