Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN AWAY from the subscriber, on the night of the 3d inst, a likely young negro fellow named JOHN, formerly the property of Col. Michael Payne, of Edenton; he is a smart sensible fellow, and speaks good English, about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, wears his hair tied; had on when he went away a short blue jacket and trowsers, and carried with him sundry other cloaths, particularly a short brown and green coat faced with red.  I rather expect he is lurking about Edenton, waiting for an opportunity to get away in some vessel, as he has a very great desire to be free, and very probably may have got some person to write him a free pass.  Any person who will apprehend the said fellow and deliver him to me, shall receive the above reward, or ten dollars if secured in any gaol so that I get him again, and all reasonable expences.<BR>JAMES WOOD.<BR>Hertford, Dec. 10, 1796.
