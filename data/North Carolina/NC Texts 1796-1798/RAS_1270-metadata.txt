Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN away from the subscriber, on the 7th of April last, an old stout negro fellow named DICK PEPPER; a caulker by trade, and is well known in the neighbouring counties.--He had been run away from November 1793, 'till the above date, when I fell in with him by accident on Ballard's Bridge; upon seizing him he knocked down my servant and endeavoured to get me down, in the presence of one Solomon Elliott.  In searching him, I found passes granted to him by people of property, and one from a lady, authorising any person to employ or deal with said slave according to law.  I have also been informed where he has worked at his trade with different people, and they may depend on being prosecuted as it is a most villainous practice to harbour any persons property, and deprive the master at his slave's labour, and of which the owner and family might stand in need of.  I do forwarn all persons from harbouring, employing, or carrying him from this state.--I bought him November 1793, from William Littlejohn, Esq.[Esquire] Merchant Edenton, from which period he was run away till the 7th April.  The above reward will be paid to any person delivering me the named slave, and all reasonable charges.<BR>GEORGE MACKENZY.<BR>Edenton, July 4th, 1798.
