Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the night of the 12th inst. a very bright coloured mulatto man, named BEN, about five feet, 10 or 11 inches high, straight [illegible], with pretty long, bushy hair; he carried off good homespun cloathing, but perhaps he may change them. I expect he will alter his name, and endeavour to pass for a freeman. --He can make coarse shoes and saws pretty well at the whip saw. I am apprehensive he may be in company with a black fellow, who passes for a freeman, calls himself HARRY BYRD, and has a pass:-Byrd is a very noted fellow, about the height of the above mentioned Ben, and is very badly burden-both of them can read and write a little. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver the said Ben to me, or secure him in any goal, so that I get him again, and will pay all reasonable charges. <BR>JACOB COLEMAN. <BR>Warren county, August 18, 1797.
