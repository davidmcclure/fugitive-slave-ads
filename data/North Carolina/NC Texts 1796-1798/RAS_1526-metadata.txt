Transcript: RAN away from the subscriber, about 5 miles from Moore court house, N. Carolina, on Thursday night, the 15th inst. two Negroes, a man and woman, the man about 30 years of age, very black, sensible, speaks good English, reads and writes tolerable well, strong and well made, very active, especially in running and jumping, has a scar on one of his legs, occasioned by the cut of an axe, is about 5 feet 6 inches high--the woman about 27 years of age, of a yellowish complexion, a very flat nose, round cheeks, long hair, and handsome shapes.  The fellow carried away three suits of clothes, two of homespun, the other brown broadcloth--the woman a suit of dark grounded callico.  The fellow was raised in Moore county, from 6 years old--the wench on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where I expect she has persuaded the fellow with her.  I expect they will attempt to pass for free.  They took from me about three hundred and seventy five dollars, sixty French crowns in silver, the balance in gold.<BR>Whoever will deliver said Negroes to me, in Moore county, shall receive a reward of 40 Dollars, the money with them 100.<BR>I do hereby forewarn all masters of vessels from taking them on board at Petersburg, as I am apprehensive she will attempt to get back by that conveyance, as she was brought there from the Eastern Shore by water.<BR>GEORGE JACKSON.<BR>September 19.
