Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber on Saturday last, a black Negro fellow named TRIM, about 20 years of age, 4 feet 8 or 10 inches high, has a scar on his face, but on what part I cannot exactly recollect. He was raised by Doctor Isaac Guion, of Newbern, and since belonged to Mr. Peter Mangeon, of Wilmington, from whom he was last purchased.<BR>I have great reason to suppose he was concerned in a daring robbery committed in my house last night, and that he will use every effort to escape. Perhaps he may make for Wilmington, or some other seaport, therefore all masters of vessels and others are forbid harbouring or carrying him off at their peril.<BR>Whoever will deliver him to me, or secure him in any gaol, so that I get him again, shall receive the above reward, and all reasonable charges.<BR>MARGARET M'KLAN<BR>South Washington,}<BR>October, 2, tf.}
