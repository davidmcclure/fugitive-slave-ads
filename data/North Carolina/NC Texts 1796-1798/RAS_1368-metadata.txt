Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN away from the subscriber, the 8th inst. a negro fellow named JESSE, about 20 years of age, his face much scarified by a burn, and one of his hands remarkable for the same, which happened to him when he was young; he can read tolerably[sic] well, is well built, and very active, though but small.  He carried off with him a young, handsome, full-blooded, dark sorrel stud, with a large blaze down his face, 3 years old last spring; with an elegant silver tipt bridle, and an old saddle with the fore part of the tree broke.  All persons whatsoever are hereby forwarned harbouring said negro, or by any means concealing him under the penalty prescribed by law: any person that will apprehend said negro, and convey him to me, if in the state shall receive 20 dollars, if out 15; horse and negro 30 dollars if out of the state, and [illegible] if in it, besides paying all charges.<BR>JAMES BRAKIN.<BR>Orange county, on Stony Creek, Sept. 18
