Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, two men slaves, well known in Wilmington and its vicinity by the names of BUCK and PARKER.--The former is a black, of about thirty years of age, five feet eight or nine inches high, very artful, and when spoken to by a white person, will in his speech stammer a little. The latter is a yellow or mulatto colour, one or two inches higher than the former, slow in his sppech, by trade a cooper and tolerable house carpenter. He was purchased some years ago from captain James Bradley in Bladen county, near Elizabeth, and had lived thereabouts for some time before.--From some evil disposed person he had lately got an idea of his being free, and now perhaps attempt to pass as such. Masters of vessels and others are hereby forbid at their peril, from employing, harbouring or concealing the said slaves.<BR>And any person delivering them to the subscriber, at the sound, or securing them in the goal of Wilmington, will be entitled to the above reward, or Five Dollars for either of them, from<BR>April 13.<BR>PETER MAXWELL.
