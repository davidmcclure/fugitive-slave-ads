Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from my plantation, on Wednesday evening last, a negro lad about 18 years old, slender made, and rather knock-kneed--he served his time to mr. Peter Harris, blacksmith, in Wilmington, where He is well known; and he says he has a wife, a negro girl belonging to mr. Vance, named Lucinda, whom it is probable may secret him. Whoever apprehend the said negro and bring him to me at the Hermitage, or confine him in any goal, shall receive the above reward. Masters of vessels are forwarned not to carry him off or employ him on board any vessel, &c.<BR>John Burgwin.<BR>Hermitage, 17th March.
