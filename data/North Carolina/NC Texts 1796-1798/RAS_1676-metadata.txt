Transcript: RUN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 16th instant, a negro fellow named HARRY, about five feet ten or eleven inches high, of a yellowish complexion, very thick set, and has an out-mouth, and when particularly accused has a down guilty look.  He took away with him a brown holland coat, white waistcoat and white breeches.  I expect he will try to get into Virginia, and endeavour to pass as a free man.  15 dollars reward will be given if taken out of the state, or ten dollars if taken within it.<BR>WM.[WILLIAM] JACKSON.<BR>August 23, 1797.
