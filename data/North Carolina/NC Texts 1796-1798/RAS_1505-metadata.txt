Transcript: RAN away from my Overseer, at Castle Haynes Plantation, an old Negro Woman named Nancy, & her son named Harry, about 18 years old. They are the wife & son of old Cupid, in Wilmington, by whom it is supposed they are harboured or secreted; or perhaps they may be about Old Town, harboured by some of Mr. Carson's negroes. Whoever takes up the said negroes and brings them to me, at the Hermitage, or secures them in the jail at Wilmington, so that I may have them, shall receive FIVE DOLLARS for the Woman, and TWENTY DOLLARS for Harry.<BR>If the said Negro Woman surrenders herself within a month--as an old, and before this elopement, faithful servant she will be forgiven. And as I am convinced in my own mind, that Cupid has been the cause of this elopement, I will give to any person Two Dollars, who will deliver the said negro Cupid to me at the Hermitage.<BR>JOHN BURGWIN.<BR>N.B. Nancy's face is marked with the small-pox, and she has thick lips, but speaks plain. Harry is smooth faced has a sluffish walk, but speaks plain and plausible.<BR>April 26 1798.
