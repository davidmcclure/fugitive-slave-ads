Transcript: Twenty Five Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away on Saturday, the 15th inst. from the Subscriber living near Tarborough, in Edgcomb county, (N.C.] a mulatto negro man, about half blooded, named ROBBIN, about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, about 35 years of age, well set, and round face, large neck, steps lively, one of his little fingers is off near the fist joint, has a small scar over one of his eyes, one on one of his heels, and one on his breast, his hair is very short.  I bought him of William Johnston Dawson, of Bertie county, near Edenton--he is a shoe maker and a cooper; he took a white flannel jacket with him which he will wear, he also wore a wool hat.  His name he will probably change, and try to pass as a free man, and may perhaps get a free pass. I expect he will try to get on board some vessel--I forwarn all masters of vessels and other persons from harbouring, employing, or carrying said negro away -- The above reward will be given to any person securing him in any jail, so that I get him again, and if brought home to me, all reasonable expences will be paid.<BR>ELIAS BRYAN.<BR>September 27, 1798.
