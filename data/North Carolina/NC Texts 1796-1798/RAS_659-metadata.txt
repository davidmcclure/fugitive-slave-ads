Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN away, on the 7th of May, 1796, a LAD, of about 17 or 18 years of age, about 5 feet 3 or 4 inches high, straight and well made, though rather slender, of a yellowish complexion, round smooth face, and when spoken to has a custom of turning his face aside; when he smiles you may perceive dimples in his cheeks, his chin is rather short, with a mouth moderately small, his feet rather long, straight, and pretty narrow which, will be sufficient to apprehend him.  This boy, I have reason to expect, is in Pasquotank county, and has fraudulently obtained a pass signed by me.<BR>JESSE SIMMONS.<BR>N.B. Any person who will apprehend said slave and deliver him to me in Currituck county, shall receive the above reward.    2w
