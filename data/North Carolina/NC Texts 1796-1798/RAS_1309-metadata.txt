Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD<BR>MADE his escape, on the 16th instant, near Hertford, in Perquimans, my negro fellow JOB; he is about 5 feet 6 inches high, rather black, has remarkable small feet and hands, 25 or 30 years of age; he was bred in Perquimans, and probably he may be lurking about there, as he has a mother and other relations not far from Hertford, he was one of the negroes emancipated by the Quakers, and taken up and sold by order of court; it is more than probable that they may wish to secret him; all those who offend that way, may rely on being dealt with in the utmost severity of the law.  The above reward will be given to any person that will deliver said negro me, or confine him in gaol so that I get him again, together with all reasonable expences.<BR>THOMAS POOL.<BR>Pasequetank, Nov. 28, 1796.
