Transcript: Thirty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, a young Negro Fellow named NED, about five feet eight or nine inches high, has remarkable full eyes, and tells a plausible story. He was seen about twelve months ago at Harrison's creek, and possibly is lurking about Topsail, and may endeavour to get amongst a large number of Negroes. If any person will secure him in Wilmington Jail so that I get him, or deliver him at my plantation 30 miles above Wilmington, shall receive the above reward and all reasonable expences paid.<BR>William Watts Jones.<BR>March 8.<BR>62
