Transcript: FOUR DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>  RUN AWAY from the subscriber on the 11th instant, a yellow negro slave, about twenty years old, named SIP; has been to sea. I have been informed of his being harboured about town. I forwarn all Captains of vessels from carrying him on board their vessels, or employing him upon any pretence whatever; and all persons from harbouring him in their kitchens, houses or premises, as they may depend on being prosecuted, if found in any person's house, or employ; and the above reward will be given to any one who will deliver him. <BR>  GEORGE MACKENZY. <BR>  Edenton, July 24th, 1798.
