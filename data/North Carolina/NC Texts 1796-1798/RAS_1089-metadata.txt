Transcript: FIFTEEN DOLLARS REWARD<BR>RUN away from the Subscriber, in Edenton, on the 16th ult. a Negro Man named ISAAC, about 33 years old, stout made, broad face, and a little yellowish, his under lip is thick and hangs down, when he is alarmed or goes to speak quick, he is apt to stammer, and answeres[sic] yes, without the sir; had on when he ranaway a round blue jacket lined with Osnabergs, and blue trowsers, ribbed yarn stockings, and took with him a blue great coat, two new shirts of ticklenburg.  He can work a little at the shoe making business, and has been a voyage or two to sea; it is likely he has a free pass, and will endeavour to get to Norfolk, or on board of some vessel bound to the northward.  The above reward will be given on his delivery to me in Edenton, and all reasonable expences, should he be taken any distance from here.  All persons are forewarned from harbouring or employing him in any manner whatever and all masters of vessels from carrying him off, under the penalty of the law.<BR>ELISHA NORFLEET.<BR>Edenton, January 26th, 1798
