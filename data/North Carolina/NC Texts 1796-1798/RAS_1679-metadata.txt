Transcript: RUN away from the subscriber, two negro men; one of them a stout well looking fellow, large bold eyes, tho' a mild countenance. He has worked twelve months at the blacksmith's trade, and is pretty apt at that business:--has been from his infancy a noted run away, and is lightly branded on each cheek with the letter A.--Had on when he went away, new brown cloth trousers, light coloured cloth jacket, and was otherwise well clad. As I know his situation in his servile state, could not have been more comfortable than it had been made in point of diet, lodging and clothing, by me, since placing him in the smith's shop in particular; I can believe no other than that his aim is to get out of the state by sea. He has relations in the family of Mr. John Kornegay, on Trent, and acquaintances in Newbern, and about Mr. Southy Rew's on south river, and may lurk about these places till he meets some captain, who will be base enough to secrete or steal him. His name is<BR>ISAAC<BR>I will pay TWENTY DOLLARS for delivering him to me securely tied, or securing him in any gaol, so that I get him; or for killing and destroying him; he is duly outlawed. FORTY DOLLARS on due proof of any free person worth the sum, harbouring, succouring or employing him. An HUNDRED DOLLARS on proof of any master of a vessel suffering him on board, contrary to law, provided the the masters and vessels name, and where owned, be made known to me, and that process can be served on the captain in this state. Isaac's age is about 19 years.<BR>The other fellow is the property of Timothy Parmule, minor, hired to me by the year. He is about seventeen years old, has a sullen down and guilty look. The white of his eye, has a red cast, stature rather low; his name is<BR>ABEL;<BR>his being an arrant run away, was a reason of his being place with me a few days before his elopement, but indifferently clad.--And strange as the fact is, his clothes were measured and cut out, the very night preceding that of his running away. He has been once or twice before committed to Newbern gaol, and on his former excursions, made Mr. John Kornegay's neighbourhood, his range. For deiivering[sic] Abel to me, or securing him in any gaol, so that I get him, I will pay eight dollars.<BR>JOHN ALDERSON.<BR>Hyde County, January 24.<BR>N.B. It is hoped all good citizens, owners of slaves in particular, will be aiding to suppress the dangerous practice.
