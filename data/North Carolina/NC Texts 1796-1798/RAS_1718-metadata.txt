Transcript: RUN away from the subscriber, living in Hyde county, a young negro fellow, of about 17 or 18 years of age, rather low of stature, is black, and has a sullen, down, and guilty look, the whites of his eyes have a reddish cast; his proper name is ABEL, though he frequently passes by the name of Abram; he has very lately been taken up, and was in possession of one Jethro Pindar, near Murfreesborough, for a few days; Pindar says he afterwards escaped from him; it is possible though that he may have taken some undue step with Abel; if however the fellow escaped from him, it is likely he will endeavour to get into Virginia or Maryland; he was ten or twelve years ago brought from the eastern shore of Maryland, and was bought in Hyde by Col. Benjamin Parmerle, and now is the property of the orphan son of that man, hired by me for the present year.  I will pay on delivery of Abel, at my house in Hyde aforesaid, after the rate of two shillings per mile for the distance he may be apprehended from thence, or twenty dollars for securing him duly in any gaol, and giving me immediate notice, so that I get him.  I hope all friends of good order will be aiding, in apprehending him, &d. thereby contributing to suppress the pernicious practice of running away.<BR>J. ALDERSON.<BR>N.B. A line addressed to me by post to Washington will reach me readily.<BR>March 16, 1797.
