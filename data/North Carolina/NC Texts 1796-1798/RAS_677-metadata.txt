Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>TO any person who will bring to me, or take up and secure so that I get him, a negro man, named SAM, belonging to the estate of FREDERICK SPELLINGS, dec. about thirty years of age and I suppose him to be upwards of six feet high, of a yellowish complection, and is pitted with the smallpox, which at a distance has some resemblance of freckles, and he has a scar on one of his cheeks.  I expect he will endeavour to pass for a freeman, as he can read and write.  He was brought from the West Indies, and is supposed he will make for Petersburg, or some other place where vessels are lying.  All masters of vessels and others are forwarned from harbouring or carrying away said slave.<BR>JESSE READ, Administrator.<BR>Halifax county, January 4.
