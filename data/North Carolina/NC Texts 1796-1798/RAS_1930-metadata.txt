Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, a negro man called ANDREW, he is a stout thick set short fellow, about 24 years of age, remarkably dirty and slovenly in his general appearance, his hair thick, short and matted, and tho' a country-born, I question if it was ever combed; he has small eyes and thick blubber lips; the fellow was raised at the plantation that Mr. McGuire lived at, on the North-West, and it is possible he will harbour between that and Gen. Brown's, as he has a negro woman of the General for a wife; tho' it is more probable he may be taken lurking about Fayetteville, as he was accustomed two years ago to row in the boats that ply between Wilmington and that place. Whoever will apprehend said negro and deliver him at my plantation, or to the goaler in Wilmington, shall have the above reward paid them by<BR>JOHN HILL.<BR>April 6.<BR>tf
