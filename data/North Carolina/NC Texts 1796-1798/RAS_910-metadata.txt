Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber living in Granville County, near Williamsborough, about the first of June last, a negro boy named MINOR, between 17 and 18 years of age, sensible, likely, and well grown, country born, rather a yellowish complection[sic] for a negro, pretty large eyes, and stammers a little in his speech when he talks fast.  He has rode with me some time as a waiting-man, and he is acquainted with most parts of the state.  Some time after he ran away he was taken up in Mecklenburg or Cabarrus county, and committed to gaol in Charlotte, from whence he was taken to be brought home, and about 50 miles below the Yadkin river, about the first of July last, made his escape.  Any person apprehending the said negro, and committing him to some gaol where I may get him again, shall receive the above reward, and if brought home thirty dollars.<BR>JOHN WILLIAMS.
