Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>A MULATTO fellow belonging to me, named ALLSTON, ran away last week from Mr. Gorton Chace, to whom I had hired him for one year--he is tall, well made, about the age of 23 years, and remarkably expert as a workman in the shoemaker's trade. It is probable this fellow has left the state; if so, whoever will apprehend him out of the state, and deliver him to me, or to Mr. Chace, shall receive from me the above reward--if the fellow is taken within the state, on his being delivered to Mr. Chace the person delivering him will be paid the sum of Ten Dollars, and all reasonable charges paid.<BR>W. H. HILL.<BR>N. B. Massters of vessels, it is hoped, will take this as a caution.<BR>April 5.<BR>66. 3
