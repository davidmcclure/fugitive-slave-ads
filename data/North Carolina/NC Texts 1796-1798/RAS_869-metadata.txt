Transcript: FIFTEEN DOLLARS REWARD<BR>RAN away the night of the 15th inst from my house in this county, a negro lad, named SOLOMON, about five feet two inches high, twenty years of age, yellowish complexion, has a large full [illegible] eye, speaks plain, thick lips, and his upper lip rather turns up, broad foot, a mark on the back part of his neck blacker than the rest of his skin, and it is supposed to be wrinkled.--Had on when he went away, a homespun shirt, trowsers[sic] almost new, and an old wool hat high in the crown. He has once made for Petersburg but I have a reason to believe he is stolen and carried to some part of the back country. The above reward will be given to any person that takes up said negro and brings him to me, or secures him in any gaol so that I get him again; and fifteen dollars for the thief, if the negro is stolen.<BR>SARAH DANIEL.<BR>Warren County, August 15.
