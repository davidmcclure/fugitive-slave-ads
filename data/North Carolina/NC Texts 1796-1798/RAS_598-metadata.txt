Transcript: TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUNAWAY on Saturday the 15th inst. a Mulatto Negro Slave, about half blooded, named Robbin, about five feet six or seven inches high, a middle aged man, well fed, a round face, and a large neck ; steps lively, has a scar on his breast, and one of his little fingers is off near the first joint, his hair is nappy and very short : he carried away with him, a white flannel jacket, which perhaps he may wear.  He was bought of Wm[William] J. Dawsen, late of Bertie county, near Edenton : and it is expected he will try to obtain a pass, pass as a freeman, and endeavour to get on board a vessel.  He will probably change his name and clothes.  I forewarn all masters of vessels from harbouring or employing him.  He is a shoemaker and cooper.  The above reward will be given to whoever secures him in any gaol so that I get him again and if brought home reasonable expences.<BR>14 miles above Tarborough, Edg[e]comb county.<BR>Sept. 17.    ELIAS BRYAN.
