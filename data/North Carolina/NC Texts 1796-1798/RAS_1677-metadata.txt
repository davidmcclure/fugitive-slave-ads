Transcript: RUN away from the subscribers in Northampton county, about four miles from Murfreesborough, on the night of the 6th instant, a negro boy by the name of JIM, about 19 years of age; he is slim made and very yellow; had on when he went off a green jacket and overalls; and carried with him a small horse blanket, and a pair of thickset breeches and some other cloathing.  He has a blinked eye, occasioned by sticking a fork in it when young.  He is about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, his heels very much cracked.  I expect that he will try to pass as a free person.  Any person that will apprehend said negro, and bring him to me, shall have TEN DOLLARS reward.  I forewarn all persons from harbouring him or trading with him, &c.<BR>ARTHUR WILLIAMS.<BR>April 8, 1797.
