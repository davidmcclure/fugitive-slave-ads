Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY on the 12th day of May last, from the subscriber living in Brunswick county, near the lower Cut-bank bridge on Nottoway river, a  large likely Negro fellow, about thirty five years old, named BOB, formerly the property of THOMAS WASHINGTON, dec.[deceased] of said county : he is of a lightish complexion, and has had both of his feet burnt-- the right foot is drawn up ; it is probable he will attempt to pass as a free man, as I have reason to believe he has got a free pass.--Whoever will deliver said Negro to me or secure him in any jail, so that I get him again, shall receive the above reward, exclusive of all legal charges.<BR>June 30.    3   DAVID TUCKER, jun.
