Transcript: RAN away from the subscriber about eight day past, a Negro fellow by the name of JOHN who calls himself JOHN GARDENER--he is a short active well set fellow; and is by trade a Blacksmith. I think he has a scar on his face, but exactly where i do not remember. He would be known in Fayetteville by Mr. Grove's negroes, in Wilmington by Mr. D. Moor's, in Chatham by Mr. Mallett's. I think he is endeavouring to get on board some vessel to go round to the northward, and should he fail at Wilmington, he will go to Newbern. I will give Fifty Dollars to any person who will apprehend and secure the said fellow so that I get him again, and pay all reasonable charges, &c.<BR>W. NASH.<BR>N. B. A fellow by the name of ROBIN, belonging to Mr. Garrot Goodloe, went off with him. Mr. Goodloe, I doubt not, will give an equal reward for his.<BR>W.N.<BR>Caswell county, July 17.
