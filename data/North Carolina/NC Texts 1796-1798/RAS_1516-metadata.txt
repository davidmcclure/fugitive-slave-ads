Transcript: RAN away from the subscriber on the 21st instant, a likely negro man named BOB--about 26 years of age, 6 feet high, stout made, black complected and a little bow leg'd; had on when he went away, a white negro cotton jacket, and green trousers, and took a number of other clothes with him--it is probable he is aiming for Cumberland, as his wife belongs to Major John Baker, who has lately removed from this county to that place.  Any person that will deliver the said negro to me in this county, or secure him in any goal, so that I get him again, shall receive a generous reward, and all reasonable charges.<BR>ROBERT PARKER<BR>Gates County, May 24th, 1796
