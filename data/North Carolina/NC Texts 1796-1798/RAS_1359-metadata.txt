Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward <BR>Will be paid to any person who will apprehend and bring to me, at the Hermitage, in New Hanover county,  a negro fellow named YORK, who ran away last Tuesday, without the least provocation. He is a likely able bodied negro, about five feet 9 or 10 inches high--he speaks plain, and is extremely plausible and deceptious. I am told he has been frequently harboured at the big Bridge, and it is supposed is now gone up towards Long creek or Black river. The said fellow is outlawed, and whoever harbours him will be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. JOHN BURGWIN. <BR>Hermitage, 4th February.
