Transcript: TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN-AWAY, on Sunday, the 1st instant, a negro man, named LEVI, about 21 years of age, of a yellowish complexion, five feet ten or eleven inches high.  He is a good hewer, and can saw at the whip saw.  He has a brother belonging to Dr. M. Ponton, who has been runaway these two years, with whom he may try to get.  Dr. Ponton's fellow, is spare made, black complexion; a good sawyer and shoemaker--if out of the neighborhood, it is expected he will try to pass as a freeman.  Levi was branded a few days before he went away on the left cheek, with the letter D, but not being well before he went away, I cannot say how it will show, though it was very well done.<BR>DAVID DAY.<BR>Near Halifax Town, October 7.    73
