Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 12th of March last, a mulatto fellow named JIM, about twenty five years of age, stout and well made, has very large feet, speaks plain: It is supposed, he has made towards Virginia, where he expects to be free.  He has been in Tarborough jail, and broke from thence on the 16th of April last.  It is probable he will attempt to pass for a free man by the name of Jim Houser, as one Mr. Houser raised him at the Moravian Towns in this state. Whoever will apprehend said fellow and secure him in any jail, so that I can get him again, shall be entitled to the above reward, and if brought to me at this place, shall be paid the sum of Ten Pounds.  All persons are forewarned harboring said fellow, or taking him out of the state.<BR>JOHN DICKSON<BR>Fayetteville, June 9th, 1796
