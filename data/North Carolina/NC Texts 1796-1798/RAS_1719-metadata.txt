Transcript: RUN AWAY from the subscriber, in February last, a Negro Man, named BRITCH, about 5 feet eight inches high, and large in proportion, black complected, thick lips, very knock-kneed, remarkable long feet, about 22 years of age ; he saws tolerably well with the whip-saw.  From the length of time he has been gone, I am induced to suppose he is secreted by some person for his own benefit, or that he has been enticed to runaway with some villain, either to live with or make sale of.  I will give a reward of TEN DOLLARS to any person that will deliver him to me, or confine him in some jail so that I may get him again--and if stole, a reward of TWENTY POUNDS for the thief.  Wm.[William] VERELL<BR>Franklin county, Sept. 4.
