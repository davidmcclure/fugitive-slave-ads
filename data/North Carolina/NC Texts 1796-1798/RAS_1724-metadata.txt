Transcript: RUNAWAY from the subscriber this day, a Negro Fellow, named KING, twenty five years of age, about four feet ten inches high, stout and well made, yellowish complexion, very white teeth, rather lisps in his common talking, has a few scars on his back, occasioned by the whip; has a remarkable scar on one of his feet : he had on when he went off a pair of old blue negro cotton breeches, and a new oznaburghs shirt, being all the clothes he took off ; he also left his hat behind.  He ranaway six or seven years ago, and was caught at Tarborough in N. Carolina.  It is expected he will endeavour to pass for a freeman, as he did before : he is a smooth-tongued fellow, and will deceive almost every person who has anything to do with him, being a very great liar.  Whoever apprehends and secures him in a gaol, so that he may be got again, or brings him home, shall receive a reward equal to their trouble, and all reasonable charges.<BR>He may alter his name, as did he before.<BR>JOHN SHORT.<BR>Northampton county, N.C. June 7.    8
