Transcript: Forty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the Hermitage, last night, two Negroes. One of them named FRANK, a cooper, who formerly worked on my wharf in Wilmington--he is about five feet four inches high, has remarkable thick lips. He has been lately whipped for a felony he committed, and had an iron on one of his legs. The other named NED, who served his time with Messrs. Harris and Springs, blacksmiths, in Wilmington; and it is supposed has been persuaded to this elopment by Frank, for the purpose of filing off his iron clogg--Ned is a tall slender made boy, with a good countenance. A reward of Twenty Dollars each, will be paid to any person that will apprehend either of the said negroes, and deliver them or either of them to me at the Hermitage. And as I have reason from some recent circumstances, to believe, that my negro fellow York, (advertised in this paper) has been harboured by some evil disposed person, I will give a reward of Thirty Dollars to any person that will give me information of such harbouring, on conviction; and Thirty Dollars to any person who will deliver the said negro York, to the goaler of any safe goal, so that I may have him again. The said three fellows are outlawed, and may be shot, unless they return to me in ten days.<BR>JOHN BURGWIN.<BR>Hermitage, April 12.<BR>tf
