Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Newbern, a Negro Fellow, called WILL, formerly the property of Col. Long, of Halifax.  He is about five feet six inches high, 22 years of age, and has (I think) lost one or more of his foreteeth.  Being so well known about Halifax, where he is supposed to be lurking, a more particuarly description is deemed unnecessary.  Whoever will secure him in any gaol, shall receive one half the above reward, and if delivered to me in Newbern, the above sum and all reasonable charges.  ROBERT HUNT.<BR>Newbern, July 10.    15 3
