Transcript: RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, on the 29th of July, 1797, a negro man named JOE; about 35 years of age, about five feet high, well proportioned, his left eye out, and speaks very broken : he had on when he went off an osnaburg shirt and trowsers[sic], and negro cotton jacket -- I expect that he has got a pair.  Any person that will take up said negro, and put him in jail, or fetch him to me in Edgecomb county, near the Great Falls of Tar Heel, so that I may get him again, shall receive a generous reward, and all expenses paid.<BR>RENNISON TISDAL.
