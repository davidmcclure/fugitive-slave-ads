Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RAN AWAY from the Town of Newbern, on the 4th of May, 1836, a Negro Boy about eighteen or twenty years of age, which negro was carried to that place and offered by the name of GREEN. His right name is CASHUS. I purchased said negro from Harris Joiner, but he was formerly the property of Edward Stevens of Johnston county.
