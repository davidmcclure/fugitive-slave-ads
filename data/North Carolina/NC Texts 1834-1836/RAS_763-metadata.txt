Transcript: 50 DOLLARS REWARD!<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 23rd of April, on the road one mile above Wilkesborough, TWO NEGRO MEN, MILES and LEWIS--Miles is of a very dark complexion, is about five feet nine or ten inches high, about twenty one or two years of age; had on when he left me an old blue coat, mixed homespun trowsers[sic] and a black hat. Negro Miles stammers very badly. Lewis is of lighter complexion, is about 25 years old, has a pleasing countenance when spoken to--he is about five feet eight or nine inches high, thick and well set; had on when he left me an old brown fur hat, half worn or more, a thin striped jacket and a pair of tow trowsers[sic].<BR>I expect they will aim to get back to Pasquotank county in this state. I will give the above reward for the apprehension and delivery of said negroes to me in Wilkesborough, or twenty five dollars if lodged in any jail in the state so that I get them again.<BR>Any person taking up said negroes, or either of them, will please write to Richard Cooke, at Hamptonville N.C. and his letter will be promptly attended to.<BR>LEWIS R. HINTON.<BR>Wilkesborough, May, 1835.--42--4.
