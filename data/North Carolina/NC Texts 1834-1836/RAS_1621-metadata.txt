Transcript: Ranaway<BR>FROM the Subscriber about the middle of January last, a negro man named JOHN--usually called JOHN BUCK; he is about 32 years of age, five feet seven or eight inches high, not very black, square built, grave and respectful in his manner, possessing more intelligence than usual, and by trade a Blacksmith.<BR>From circumstances which have transpired, I am inclined to beleive that he has found his way to the North. If recovered beyond the limits of this State, so that I get him, I will give a reward of 200 DOLLARS. Said fellow is very well known about Wilmington, having been hired for the last 8 years at the Steam Mill of P.K. Dickinson. If found in this State I will give a reward of 100 DOLLARS.<BR>THOMAS HILL.<BR>16th June, 1835.<BR>24-tf
