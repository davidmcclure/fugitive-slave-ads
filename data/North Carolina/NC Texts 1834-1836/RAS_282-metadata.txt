Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR>LEFT my camp in Nash county, my negro boy<BR>DECATUR,<BR>About 18 or 19 years old, about six feet high, strait and slender, and yellow complected, and one of his fore fingers is stiff, caused from a cut through the joint.  This boy I purchased of Lewis Wilson, Pitt county, and where he will probably make his way back where he was brought from.  All persons are forewarned from harboring said boy, and all masters of vessels, under the severest penalty of the law, as I intend to have him.  His mother lives with said Wilson, and his father with his brother, as I am informed.  Any person who will apprehend said boy and commit him to jail, so that I get him again, shall receive the above reward--and let me know at Warrenton, North Carolina.<BR>JOHN G. YANCEY.<BR>Sept. 18. 1835.    39
