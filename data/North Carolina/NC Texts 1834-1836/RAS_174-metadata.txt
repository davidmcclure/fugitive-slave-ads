Transcript: $10 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 3rd inst., a Negro man named JIM, about 25 years of age, of light complexion, five feet 8 or 9 inches high. He is slow spoken, and in answering utters a kind of laugh. Jim was raised by a Mr. Murphy in Robeson County, and sold to James McArthur, in Marion District, S.C. of whom he was last purchased. I expect that he has made his way into Robeson or Marion as he has an extensive connexion there. The above reward will be given for his apprehension and delivery to me, livnig near Laurel Hill, in Richmond County, N.C. or for his confinement in any Jail so that I get him.<BR>DANIEL MALLOY.<BR>March 18, 1835.<BR>29 4w
