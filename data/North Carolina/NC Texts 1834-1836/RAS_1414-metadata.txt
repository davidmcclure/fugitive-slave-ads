Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on Monday night last, a negro boy named HARRY, belonging to the Estate of Hugh Matthews, dec'd. He is a tall likely fellow, about 17 years old, with an impudent and bold look--the small finger on his left hand nearly gone, occasioned by a burn. It is expected that he will aim for the neighborhood of Lawson's Store, on 12 Mile Creek, as his mother lives in that neighborhood. All persons are forewarned not to harbor said boy, as the law will be enforced against any one. The above reward will be given to any one who will lodge said boy in the jail of this county.<BR>JAMES A. HOUSTON.<BR>June 8, 1836.    3w
