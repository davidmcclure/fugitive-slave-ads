Transcript: RUNAWAYS,<BR>$20 REWARD.<BR>TWO Negro men named DAVE and GEORGE, ranaway from me at the Brindleton mines, Burke county. They were hired by me at Salisbury for one year, from the estate of Dr. Ferrand, from January last. It is probable that both these fellows are either in the neighborhood of Salisbury, or in the Jersey Settlement, Davidson county. I will give ten dollars a piece for the delivery of these men to the Sheriff of Rowan, before the first day of October next, and a reasonable reward if delivered afterwards.<BR>TENCH C. CARSON.<BR>Sept. 17, 1836--3w9
