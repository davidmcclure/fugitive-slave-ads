Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward. <BR> STOP the Runaway!--A few weeks since I purchased a Negro man, named Calvin, from A. D. Dunn, who purchased him from Robert Perry of Raleigh. Said boy was in the woods at the time I brought him, and I have reason to believe he is about Raleigh, or in the neighborhood of R. N. Jeffrey's plantation. He is a black boy; about 23 years old, stout, and somewhat knock-kneed'd, and has a smiling countenance when spoken to. The above reward will be paid to any person who will deliver said negro to me, near Roger's X roads [cross roads] in Wake county, or in jail at Raleigh. <BR> A. HESTER. <BR> April 5, 1836. 75
