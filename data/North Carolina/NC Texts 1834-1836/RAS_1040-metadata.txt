Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, in the month of January last, a negro man named JACK, and his Wife named ESTHER. The former is a Carpenter, about 40 years old, six feet high, black, speaks quick; the woman is about 30 years old, low, and of an Indian complection[sic], said to have Indian blood. I bought them from Col. Joyner, of Sampson, a short time before they ranaway. Jack was originally purchased from Mr. Edwards, of Greene County, to which neighborhood they may have returned, but it is more likely that they have gone to Florida, near Quincey. The above reward will be paid for their apprehension and confinement in any Jail, so that I get them, or $20 for any information that may lead to their recovery.<BR>HEROLD BLACKMORE.<BR>Duplin County, Sept. 10, 1835.<BR>54tf.
