Transcript: STOP THE RUNAWAYS!<BR>RUNAWAY from the Subscriber, living 14 miles North of Raleigh, on Friday night the 12th instant, his negro boy ABRAHAM and his wife GRACE.-- The man is 27 years of age, about 6 feet high, well proportioned, with tolerably thick lips, and the woman is about 36--the former not very dark complected--the later, tall, this visaged, and quite dark.  Abraham had no marks that I recollect of save that on the day of the election he got into a fight in Raleigh; and received a severe blow over the left eye, the effects of which will probably remain sometime.  He is remarkable too, for a bold, impudent, swaggering air, which will attract the attention of everyone.  The woman has a notable letter[?] or tumor on one of her hands, which, if examined, cannot fail to lead to her being identified.  They will aim for Petersburg, I think, the boy having been for years engaged in the wagoning business to and from that place.<BR>I will give FIFTY DOLLARS reward for the apprehension of Abraham and TEN DOLLARS for his wife, if taken in the State, or double that amount, if taken out of the State.<BR>DAVID GILL.<BR>Wake Co. August 15.    39<BR>The Star, and Petersburg Intelligencer will insert the foregoing for six weeks, and send their bills to this Office.
