Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 15th inst., a negro boy named SAM, yellow complected, 25 years of age; some of the principal marks are, a scar on his throat, occasioned by the cut of a knife, the forefinger of his right hand stands straight and powerless, in consequence of being cut by a Cotton Gin, and also, all the fingers on the same hand are more or less injured from the same cause, so that he cannot straighten nor entirely shut them.
