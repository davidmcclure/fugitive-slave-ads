Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>THE above Reward will be paid to any person, for the apprehension of my negro man AARON, or for his confinement in any Jail so that I get him.  Aaron is about 35 years old, light complected, about 5 feet 6 inches high, his front teeth are very white and sound.  He has a slight defect in one of his hips, which may be perceived from his walking.  He has on, probably, a blue coat and snuff-colored homespun pantaloons, with a wide brimed[brimmed] fur or felt hat.  He ran away the 25th of October last, has a wife at John Hadley's, in Chatham, about 15 miles North-west of Pittsborough.  He formerly belonged to Peter Perry, of said county, and is well acquainted on the Cape Fear River, as far down as Fayetteville, having worked on the river as a boat hand.  I think it likely he will attempt to pass as a free man, and may probably have procured a free pass, or a pass from some person permitting him to hire himself to any one who will employ him.   Aaron may attempt to reach Wilmington, and make his escape on board some vessel.<BR>WOODSON LEA.<BR>Pittsborough, Dec. 7.<BR>Fayetteville Observer will insert until the order is countermanded.
