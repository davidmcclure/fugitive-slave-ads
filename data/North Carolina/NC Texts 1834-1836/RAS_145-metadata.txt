Transcript: $100 Reward,<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension of my Mulatto Man JO: (known in Wilmington as JO: GRANGE) or for such information as will lead to my recovery of him. He is some 25 years old; rather robustly made; stoops considerably when in motion; has something of a limp in his gait (th'[though] no natural defect:) is about five feet seven inches high; when addressed speaks slowly and simperingly. He has a full suit of hair; gray eyes; an unusual number of wrinkles about the angles of his mouth, and his teeth much discolored from the use of Tobacco. He has a scar upon his breast, occasioned either by a burn or a blister--his chest very hairy. He has also a strange peculiarity about his feet, viz. the two toes next adjoining the great toe, on each foot, are connected together, one half their length, or to the middle joint of each. He is two thirds white, and when cleanly dressed, ""might pass"" for a white man.<BR>It is expected he has taken shipping for the 'north,' and if so, I will further give $100 for such evidence as may convict the person or persons concerned in his abduction.<BR>He left this between the 21st and 30th ult.<BR>H. Y. WADDELL.<BR>Nov. 12.<BR>97--tf.
