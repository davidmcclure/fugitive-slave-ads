Transcript: $50 REWARD,<BR>RUNAWAY, from the subscriber, in Granville county, (N.C.) on the 20th June, a negro man named GID, about 21 years old, of yellow complexion, (tho' not very bright) about 6 feet 2 or 3 inches high, weighing about 150 or 160 lbs. His front teeth, it is believed, are a little decayed on the edges. He is quick spoken and shows the whites of his eyes plainly when he looks at you.  He took with him a plain mized frock coat, vest and pantaloons of domestic cloth, also a dark mixed vest and dark brown (approaching black) homespun pantaloons, with a decent fur'd black hat, &c. He is a keen sensible fellow, of remarkably bad temper and disposition, and has, in consequence of it marks of the lash upon his back.<BR>It is believed that he will either endeavor to pass as a free man (and probably has a free pass even at this time) or pretend to belong to and pass in company with some man or woman, who may be taking him off clandestinely to sell him in some of the Western or Southern States, or be taking him to some free State. And from some circumstances which recently took place between him and a pedlar (as related by my other negroes since he absconded) I should not be surprised if he were advised and befriended in some way by the pedlar.  The above reward of fifty dollars will be given to any person who will apprehend him and confine him in any Jail within this State, so that I can get him again, or sixty dollars if without the State.<BR>JOSIAH CRUDUP.<BR>June 21, 1836.    87--3t.
