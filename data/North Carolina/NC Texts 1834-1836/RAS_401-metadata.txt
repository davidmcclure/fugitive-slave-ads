Transcript: $50 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY between Saturday night last and this morning, a negro man named JIM, sometimes calling himself JAMES LORD. He is about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, well made, and of ordinary size. Nothing remarkable either in his appearance or manners. He was raised on a farm and has some little knowledge of Cooper's work, but has been chiefly employed for two or three years past as a pressman in the Observer Office. It is probable that he will aim for Wilmington, as he formerly lived at Rocky Point, near that place, and has a mother living in the town. The above reward will be paid if he is apprehended beyond the limits of this State, or $25 if within the State, provided I get him again.<BR>E. J. HALE.<BR>May 4, 1835.
