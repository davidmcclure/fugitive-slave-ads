Transcript: $50 REWARD.<BR>I WILL give Fifty Dollars for the apprehension of a Negro Woman named<BR>BESS, and her CHILDREN--<BR>supposed now to be three in number--or in like proportion for as many of the family as may be had.<BR>This woman has been runaway about 8 years, and was the property of Joseph Green, dec'd[deceased] at the time of her elopement. She was sold at public sale at Smithville, as the property of said Green's Estate, and purchased by John P. Gause, Esq. who sold her to Benj[Benjamin] S. Leonard, of whom I purchased her with all the children she may have. She is described to be of yellow complexion, low of stature, hair inclining to straitness[sic], has a scar mark on one or other side of her cheek, extending along the neck, caused from  a blister; and when last seen had some of her fore teeth much decayed, which are doubtless gone by this time.<BR>It is possible that this woman may be passing by some assumed name, and as free, and that her children may be in some keeping as such.<BR>If this woman will come in to me, and bring her children, without trouble or expense, I will, in the event of her being dissatisfied with me as her owner, give her leave to suit herself with one of her liking.<BR>ARCH'D[Archibald] McRAE.<BR>March 11, 1835.<BR>10-tf.
