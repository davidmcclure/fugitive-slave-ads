Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 5th of June last, a Negro Boy named JERRY,--about 19 years old, of dark complexion, spare made,--has a small scar across his nose, and is 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high. He has connexions in Newbern and at the plantation of J. C. Stanly, near that place, at one of which places he is no doubt concealed. The penalty of the law will be rigidly enforced against any person who may be found to harbour or secret said negro, and a reward of fifty dollars may be had by the person arresting and securing him in jail, or for his delivery at my residence, ten miles from Newbern. <BR>HARDY O. NEWTON. <BR>Jones County, February 22, 1836. <BR>I have understood that Jerry has endeavored to obtain free forged papers, and it is probable that he will exhibit a free pass and call himself JERRY BRADICK; Masters of vessels are therefore cautioned against carrying off said negro under the penalty of the law. <BR>H.O.N.
