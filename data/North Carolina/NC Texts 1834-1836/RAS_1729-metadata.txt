Transcript: Runaway Negro.<BR>MY negro boy HENRY left my plantation the 30th of January last. He is of a dark complexion; 27 years old; 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, and will weigh from 180 to 200 pounds. When he left my house he had on a white woollen short coat and pantaloons of double and twisted black and white; he carried off two hats, one of white fur half worn, and the other a split black and white. He also carried off a quantity of clothing--a fine blue cloth coat, and a pair of corderoy pantaloons. I presume that he is making his way to the State of Indiana; and I will pay a reward of $50 for his delivery to me, or his confinement in any Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>WM.[William] RILEY.<BR>Randolph co., N. C., Feb. 13, 1835.--p3
