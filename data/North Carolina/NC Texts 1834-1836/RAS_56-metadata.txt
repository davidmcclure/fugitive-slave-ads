Transcript: Ran away, or Stolen<BR>FROM the subscriber, on Monday, the 20th of April last, a likely young negro boy named Willie, about 18 or 19 years of age, and weighs from 125 to 135 pounds. Willie is a chunky, well set boy, has a good set of teeth, very black complexion, high, full forehead, quick spoken; had on when he went off blue dyed pantaloons, checked roundabout, a wool hat, coarse winter shoes with tacks in the bottoms.
