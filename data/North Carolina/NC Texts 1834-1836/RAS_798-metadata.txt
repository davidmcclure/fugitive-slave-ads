Transcript: 50 DOLLARS<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension and delivery to me in Charlotte, of a Negro man, JOHN or JACK. He was raised by old David Moore, and was purchased from John Blount, Esq. John is a black fellow about 24 years of age. I supposed he is lurking in the Waxhaw or Providence settlement, as his Mother lives in the former, and his wife in the latter settlement. He is well known as one of Moore's stock of Negroes.<BR>ROBERT HUIE, or<BR>JOHN JONES.<BR>August 31, 1835.    58-tf
