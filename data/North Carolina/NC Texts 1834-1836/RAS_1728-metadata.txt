Transcript: Runaway Negro.<BR>A NEGRO girl named Delia, ran away from the subscriber on the 13th ultimo. She is a bright Mulatto, about 17 years old.  There is no doubt she is concealed somewhere in Raleigh, or neighborhood, by some designing person, in order to get her out of my possession.  I hereby forewarn all persons from harboring or purchasing said girl.  A liberal reward will be given to any person who will apprehend and deliver her to me, or confine her, so that I get her again.<BR>L. HUTCHINGS.<BR>Wake county, April 6, 1836    75
