Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 1st of May last, a Negro man by the name of TIM, about 41 years of age, dark complected, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, well built, has lost some of his jaw teeth, and carried off sundry clothing, among whose were a coarse gray cloth roundabout coat and pantaloons, a pale blue sattinet frock coat, home-made pantaloons, cotton shirts and wool Hat.  I expect he has made for the Roanoke, as I purchased him some years ago from Doctor Simmons Baker of Martin county.  I will give the above reward of One Hundred Dollars for the apprehension and securing the said Negro in Jail, if taken out of this State, or Fifty Dollars if taken in this State, so that I get him again.<BR>ROBERT HARRISON.<BR>Raleigh, 22d July, 1836.    27 3t<BR>Star, three times.
