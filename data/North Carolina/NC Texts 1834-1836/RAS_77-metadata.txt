Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>From the subscriber, living in the City of Raleigh, negro girl MARTHA, about five feet 6 inches high, of bright complexion. She has a small scar on the back of one of her hands, occasioned by a burn when a child--which hand not recollected. No other scar recollected. Speaks slow when spoken to, and rather carelessly.--It is unnecessary to describe her dress, as she carried off much clothing with her. A reasonable reward will be given for her apprehension, or for information where I can get her again.<BR>REUBEN PERRY.<BR>Raleigh, N. C. July 21, 1835<BR>31 tl[?]
