Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscribers, about the 1st instant, a bright mulatoo man, Henry, about 25 years old, say 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, well made, and sensible. Having reason to believe he has a free pass from one Madison Curry, no doubt Henry will endeavor to pass for a free man. His clothing was mostly of store cloth : one of his coats trim'd with Velvet.  The above reward will be paid for his confinement so that I get him again, or his delivery to me.<BR>T. ALSTON.<BR>Wake Forest, Jan 16, 1835    12
