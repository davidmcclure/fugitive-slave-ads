Transcript: Notice.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on Wednesday night the 24th February last, my negro boy<BR>ISAAC,<BR>Eighteen or nineteen years old, five feet six or eight inches high, thick set, his clothing not recollected. It is believed that he may be lurking somewhere in this county, or may perhaps have left his native neighborhood, as the last I heard from him he was in the neighborhood of the Nash county line, enquiring the way to the Factory on Tar river. A liberal reward will be paid to any person for apprehending said boy and fetching him home to me, four miles from Stantonsburg, in Edgecombe county, or confining him in jail so that I get him again.<BR>COFFIELD ELLIS.<BR>6th March, 1836.<BR>10
