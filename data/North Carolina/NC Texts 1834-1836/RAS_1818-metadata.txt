Transcript: Runaways.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the night of the 2d instant, a Negro Man, by the name of Kinchelow.  Said boy Kinchelow was raised by a man by the name of George Nance, living 15 or 16 miles south east of Raleigh, and Nance sold him to a man by the name of Frederick Lilley, and Lilley to Allen Dunn of Raleigh, and from Dunn to the subscriber. Said boy Kinchelow is 6 feet or upwards, about 25 or 26 years of age; he has, on close examination, a speck in his left eye, and pretends that he cannot see out of it; he is tolerably likely, and of dark complexion.<BR>And also, on the night of the 3d instant, a Negro Man, by the name of Osborn, who said he was raised by a man by the name of Jeffreys; a man by the name of Strickland sold him to Allen Dunn of Raleigh, and Dunn sold him to the subscriber. Said boy Osborn is about 5 feet 5 1/2 inches high, between 35 and 40 years of age, of yellow complexion, this visage, and tolerably large forehead, had on white hat, black jeans coat, and other clothing not recollected. Osborn no doubt will try to pass as a free man, as it is likely he has procured free papers, and no doubt he is making his way for a free State.<BR>A reward of Fifty Dollars will be given for both of them, or Twenty five Dollars for either of them, or for their being lodged in any Jail, so that I get them again.<BR>JOHN A. FAUCETT.<BR>Hillsboro', Oc. 5, 1835.    4t52
