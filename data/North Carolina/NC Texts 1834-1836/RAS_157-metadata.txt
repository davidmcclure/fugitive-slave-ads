Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, a short time since three Negroes, viz;--MOSES, a wagoner, SAMPSON and JACOB, both boys, they are most likely with Moses, who is a stout, tall Mulatto, of down cast look, seldom looks a person in the face while talking; he has a high forehead. I presume he has a false free pass, and will doubtless attempt to escape through Fayetteville (where he is well known) to some non-slaveholding State--he will not be likely to show himself in Fayetteville, but will be apt to pass-off at the Wagon Yard with Deep River Cotton Wagoners easily Sampson is rather low than otherwise, not very heavy built, tolerably black, can do plain work in a blacksmith's shop, he is about 25 years old--Jacob is a slender, very black boy, about 20 years old, stutters very much. I think if a sharp look out is made at the Wagon Yard and Campbellton Landing, they may be taken. The above reward will be paid for their apprehension and confinement, so that I get them again.<BR>M R MOORE.<BR>Solomon Spainhours, September 26, 1836. 9-4w
