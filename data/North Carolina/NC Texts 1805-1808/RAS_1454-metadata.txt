Transcript: 10$ Reward if taken out of the State, and 25$ if taken in the State.<BR>RUN AWAY, from the Subscriber, near Wilkesborough, N. Carolina, on the 21st of March, a NEGRO FELLOW, named JOE, about 26 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high, black skin, has a large beard for his age, and can read and write.  I suppose he has a pass with him, and perhaps he is conveyed by some white man, or he may attempt to pass as a freeman.  He is a good Shoemaker, a tolerable Cooper, speaks plain English, has a thin visage--is an arch, cunning fellow, can tell a smooth, plausible story.  His cloathing not known.<BR>He stole and carried away with him, a small Bay Horse, about 14 hands high, branded with HB, if branded at all, has a snip in his nose, is a natural trotter, is well made, and shews[show] the Janus blood--he is marked with the Gears.<BR>The above Reward will be paid, together with all reasonable expences, if the said Negro is lodged in any Jail in the U. States, so that I get him again.  I incline to think he has made for Tennessee.<BR>JAMES WELBORN.<BR>Wilkes County, April 1.
