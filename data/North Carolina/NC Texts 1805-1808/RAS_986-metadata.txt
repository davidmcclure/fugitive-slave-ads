Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber on the 7th of September last, a likely Negro man named ABRAHAM, by trade Blacksmith, will weigh about 180 or 190, and has on his right breast a large scar ; he has been subject to the rheumatic pains, and I believe he turns out his right foot rather more than common when walking.
