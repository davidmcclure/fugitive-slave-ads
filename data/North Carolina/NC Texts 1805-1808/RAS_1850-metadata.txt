Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward. <BR>ABSENTED himself from my service on Friday Evening last, a Negro Man, named ANSWER, about 5 feet 10 inches high, 26 years old, handsome and well made, has whiskers, and holes in his ears in which he sometimes wears rings, a small scar over each eye, rather light complected, is Country born, very plausible and artful. He went off without the least provocation, but I believe under an apprehension of being sold. He is well known in Fayetteville where he was raised; but having a wife at Capt. Truman's plantation, down the river, I expect he is thereabouts. The above described slave is outlawed; but the publication of the proclamation is suspended until next Tuesday, when, if he does not previously surrender himself, a reward will be ordered for destroying him.<BR>Masters of vessels and others are cautioned against harbouring, employing or carrying him away; for proof against any person so offending, I will give a reward of Twenty Dollars; or the above reward for bringing him to me or securing him in jail so that I get him.<BR>ALLMAND HALL.<BR>October 14.
