Transcript: RUN-AWAY<BR>FROM the Subscriber on Sunday night, (7th inst.) from my quarter near Tarborough, a Negro man named JACK, and his wife NANCY. Jack is about 30 years old, and very black; he took with him a Rackoon-skin jockey cap and a hat, had on a blue overjacket, and grey cloth trowsers [sic], and took with him other clothes, all of which he will alternately change, in order to favour him from being apprehended; Nancy is about 22 years old.--They are lately from Norfolk, but I presume that may in the first instance start West, or South, and endeavour then to fall into Newbern, Washington, or some other place where they may expect to get on board of some vessel, and proceed to Norfolk.-Jack has been five times sold, and once carried to Georgia, he has always found the way back to Norfolk.  I will, for the appre[hend]ing them, so that I get them, make the most ample satisfaction, and pay all reasonable charges.<BR>HENRY COTTEN.<BR>Tarborough, Feb. 8, 1808.
