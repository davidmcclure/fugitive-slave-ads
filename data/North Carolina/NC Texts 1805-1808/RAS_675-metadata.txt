Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, living in Rutherford county, near Rutherfordton, N.C. on the 24th of November, 1805, a Negro Man named JIM, about 35 years of age, 6 feet high, yellow complected, good countenance, appears bashful and humble when spoken to, lisps a little; he took off  a number of cloathes, viz. a long homespun blue coat, a brown broad cloth coat, somewhat worn, and shoe-boots; he understands shoemaking and coopering, &c. &c. I bought him from a gentleman of Caswell county, where he has a wife and children and it is expected he intends going to them. He rode off a bay horse about six years old, well made, 15 hands high, thin hairs in his forehead in the shape of a star, shod all round and trots natural. Whoever secures the said fellow and horse, and gives me notice, shall receive the above reward and reasonable expences for keeping them, from <BR>RICHARD LEWIS<BR>Dec. 9
