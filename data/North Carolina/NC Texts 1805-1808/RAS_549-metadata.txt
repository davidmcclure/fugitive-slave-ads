He is a Guinea born negroe, and has retained a good deal of the new negro accent, he is a strong clumsy made fellow about 5 feet 6 or seven inches high, very clumsy about the feet and legs, very slovenly in his dress, goes in all weathers, generally with his shirt collar and jacket unbuttoned--he is very tricky, and very plausible and coxing when he has any favor to ask, and is apparently pleased and in good humor till he obtains his end, and when he laughs show his teeth to great advantage which are very white, he seldom combs his hair, generally lowsy[sic] and is much inclined to go dirty, no certain description can be given as to his clothing, as before he went away he swindled a negroe belonging to a vessel out of three dollars in money & some goods under the promise of buying him fowls for them, with which money and goods he will probably get himself new clothed--it is not apprehended that he is gone to sea, therefore from the date hereof all masters of vessels are cautioned, against carrying him to sea, and all others white or black harbouring him.<BR>HENRY URQUHART.<BR>Wilmington, 24th July, 1807.}
