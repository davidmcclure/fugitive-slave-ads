Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER, ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS MONTH.<BR>A NEGRO woman named PAT, she is about 32 years old, uncommonly large and masculine, is a very good weaver and fanner, uses a needle very well, and is left handed.  She has a small scar on her breast, and a scar or hump somewhere on, or between her shoulders, and I think one or two of her fingers are crooked.  She run away some years ago and attempted to pass as a free person, and it is probable that she may do the same again.<BR>I have [illegible] suspecting that she may have procured a pass, from a villain man, by the name of Tynes, who was the cause of her going off, and who as I have lately discovered, has had an intercourse and connexion with her for some time.  I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver her to me, or so secure her that I may get her again.<BR>Lovatt Burges.<BR>Halifax, July 15th, 1805    38 4w
