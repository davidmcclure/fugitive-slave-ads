Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscribers in Edgecombe county, about thirteen miles above Tarborough, on Swift creek, the 25th instant, two Negro men, NED & JACOB.  Ned is about 40 years of age, five feet six or eight inches high, of a yellow complexion, walks or moves nimble, is a [illegible] and well made, and has rather a down look ; one joint of his fore-finger is off, occassioned by a whitlow, had on when he went away a blue mixed homespun coat and breeches.  Jacob is about 35 years of age of a more yellow complexion than Ned, about six feet hight, rather slender made, speaks slow, is very sensible, can read and write, and has rather a down look--the finger on his right hand next to the little finger is stiff, occasioned by the cut of a knife; had on, or carried with him, two coats, one of a snuff colour and the other blue broad cloth.  It is supposed they will endeavor to pass for free men as they have a pretension to their freedom & likely may call themselves SWEAT or ROGERS.  Any person who will bring them to the subscribers, or confine them in anyu jail so that we get them again, shall be entitled to the baove reward or half that sun for either of them, if taken out of this county; if taken in the county of Edgecomb half the above sum for both, or one fourth for either.<BR>JOHN WILLIAMS.<BR>ETHELDRED EXUM.<BR>October 27, 1805    (3+p)
