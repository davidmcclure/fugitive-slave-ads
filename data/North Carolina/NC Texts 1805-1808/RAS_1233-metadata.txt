Transcript: Five Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the Subscriber, living on 2d Broad River, eight miles below Rutherfordton, on the 23d of September last, FOUR AFRICAN NEGRO SLAVES--one a stout built Fellow named Jack, who can speak a little broken English, has one tooth out before, and a large wart under one ear, about 20 years of age.  One other a stout Fellow, marked with the smallpox, has lost his upper fore teeth, and cannot speak a word of English.  Also, two stout built black Women, one of them has remarkably large breasts--neither of them can speak any English--one appears pregnant, and about 17 or 18 years of age.<BR>Any person who will give the subscriber notice where they may be had, shall be entitled to the above Reward; or information forwarded to Col. Gilbert, post-mastey[master], Rutherfordton, N.C. will answer equally as well, as I expect to hear of them in some Gaol either in South or North Carolina, or I will give Twenty Dollars, if delivered to my house.<BR>WILLIAM BAXTER<BR>Nov 3
