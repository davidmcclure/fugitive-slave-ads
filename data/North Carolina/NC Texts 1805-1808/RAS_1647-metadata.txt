The tallest of the Mulattoes has a Scar on one of his Wrists, and another on the Cap of his Knee ; the other is low and thickset, with a scar rather over his left Eye;--both young, but little more than twenty.  Their working Dress is Negro Cotton, but they have with them two good Swasdown Waistcoats, one a deep Orange colour; a Blue Second Coth Coast; and various mixed Homespun Pantaloons and Coats.  The smallest had 2 1-2 yds. Woolen Blue Cloth, delivered just before he went away.  They took an old Saddle with large plated Bosses, iron Stirrups and Red Padding, the Leather torn ; a country-twilled Meal Bag, an old plated Bit Bridle, some leading Lines and a Fiddle.
