Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, on the 8th inst. a Negro man named MAJOR, about 30 years old, rather of a yellow complexion, middle size--has a very large beard and generally wears it long; he had a Negro cotton jacket and mixed homespun vest and overalls, much worn. I suspect he will endeavour to pass for a free person. I will give ten dollars to any one who will take him in this county and bring him to me, and twenty dollars if taken out of the county.<BR>JULIUS HORTON.<BR>Halifax county, Oct. 30.
