Transcript: Thirty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, on the 20th of March last,  a Negro man by the name of AUSTON, about six feet high, of a yellowish complexion, and about 21 years of age; has several scars on his head, and one over his eye.  I purchased him of a Mr. Boykin, in Northampton county, an Meherrin[sic], in which neighbourhood I expect he is at this time, or about the borough of Norfolk, as it is reported he has a free pass, and wishes to pass as a free man, and get on board of some vessel; I therefore forwarn all captains and masters of vessels from taking him on board, under the penalty of the law; and whoever will secure him so that I get him again, or return him to me 12 miles above the town of Halifax shall receive the above reward.<BR>WILLIE DANIEL.<BR>Halifax, July 15, 1807.    4w--19
