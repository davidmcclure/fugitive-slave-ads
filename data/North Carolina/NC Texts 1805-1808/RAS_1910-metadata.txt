Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on Friday the 29th of August a remarkable small mulatto yellow named CAMLIN, about 40 or 45 years of age, he is rather a dark mulatto, with very long black hair, which he ties and resemeble very much the hair of an Indian, in fact I am informed he came from the East Indies.  He formerly belonged to a Mr. Monroe of Hillsborough, where I expect he will aim to go again.  I will give the above reward to any person who will secure him in any jail, so I get him again, and if delivered to me in Halifax county, all reasonable expences paid.<BR>John Alston.<BR>October 7, 1806.
