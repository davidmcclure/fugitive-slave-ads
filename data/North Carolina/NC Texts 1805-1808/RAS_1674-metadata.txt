Transcript: RUN AWAY, <BR>  From the Subscriber, at the home of Mr. Jerry Jones, jun. in Wake County, eight miles from Atkins's[?] ferry, on Cape Fear on the 26th of March, <BR>  TWO NEGROES, a man and his wife, by the names of Jeremiah and Violet. The fellow is about thirty years old, about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, well made, free spoken, and very black. His wife is of a yellow complexion, and very tall. They have a bag of clothes with them made of new cotton cloth. It is expected they are aiming for Tennessee, or James River, about old Jamestown, where the woman was raised. It is supposed they have a free pass with them. <BR>  Any person who shall apprehend the said Negroes, and bring them to me, or confine them and send me word, so that I get him again, shall be handsomely reward for their trouble and all reasonable expences. <BR>  DAVID WINSTEAD. <BR>  Nash County, Tar River, one mile from Taylor's Tavern.
