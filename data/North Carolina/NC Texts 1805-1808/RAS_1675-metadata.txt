Transcript: RUN away from the subscriber, on the 24 inst a NEGRO MAN named JIM, about 23 years of age, nearly 6 feet high, and very stout made, dark complexion, speaks very quick and plain, he sometimes plays on the fiddle. He had on when he went away a brown cloth jacket and trowsers[sic], but it is likely he may change them, as he has other clothes with him. He formerly belonged to Mr. John Moore, of Perquimans county, and I do suppose he may be lurking about there now, or in Edenton. I rather suppose he has a free pass. I will given TEN DOLLARS REWARD to any person that will confine said negro in any goal so that I get him again, or FIFTEEN DOLLARS if brought to me in Bertie county. All masters of vessels are forwarned employing or carrying off said negro, at their peril. <BR> STEPHEN M'DOWELL.<BR> Bertie county (near Coltrain)<BR> February 25th, 1806.   2t9
