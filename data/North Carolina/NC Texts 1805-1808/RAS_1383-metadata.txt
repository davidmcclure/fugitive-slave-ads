Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber on Tuesday last, a negro Man named<BR>NED<BR>Formerly the property of John C. Craft, he is about 30 years old, 6 feet high, stout made, bow legged, and has lost two of his upper fore teeth--had on when he went away a blue jacket and trousers. He has a wife at Mrs. Mott's on the Sound, and I suppose is now lurking about in that neighbourhood or in Wilmington.
