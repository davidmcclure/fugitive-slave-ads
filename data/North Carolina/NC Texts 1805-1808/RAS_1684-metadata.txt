Transcript: RUN AWAY,<BR>From John Carr and John Bensen, 10 miles above Raleigh, about 15th April last,<BR>TWO NEGROES, Puss and Ede.  Puss is a large tall Negro Fellow, six feet high, or thereabouts, very black, has lost one of his Eyes, has the appearance of about 40 years of age, is an artful, cunning fellow, and I expect will endeavour to obtain a free Pass for himself and Ede his wife, and pass as such.  Ede is about the same age, a large fat Negro, her complexion squally, inclining to yellow.  They hae[sic] with them a variety of cloaths, so that a description of them would be unnecessary.  Whoever will secure the said Negroes in Jail, so that I get them again, shall be handsomely rewarded for their trouble.<BR>CHARLES CARR.<BR>Walnut Hill, Greene County, N.C.<BR>May 26, 1807.
