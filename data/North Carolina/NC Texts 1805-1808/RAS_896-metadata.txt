Transcript: Twenty Dollars reward.<BR>ABSCONDED from me in April last, a stout Negro man named PETER, fully six feet high, about thirty years old, with bushy hair, thin visage, and rather of a yellowish complection. He was sold to me by Job Leary, of Chowan county, in November, 1802; to which neighborhood it is presumed he has attempted to return; and was known by the name of Garnzey, at the time I purchased him. I will give the above reward, together with all reasonable expences, to any person who will deliver him to me at my house in Cumberland county, or ten dollars to him confined in any jail in this state.<BR>GEORGE ELLIOT.
