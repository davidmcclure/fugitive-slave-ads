It is supposed he has gone towards Newbern, or may be lurking about Mr. John Blanks' plantation, called the Little-Bridge, where he has a brother named Ulysses.--A reward of Ten Dollars will be given to any person who will secure the said slave, so that I can get him again, and all reasonable expences will be paid.--All persons are forwarned from harbouring the said negro under the severest penalty of the law.<BR>WM.[WILLIAM] GRAVES BERRY.<BR>Dec. 15th 1807.
