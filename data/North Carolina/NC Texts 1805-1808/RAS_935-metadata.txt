He is an excellent Basket-Maker, and generally follows it wherever he goes.  Sometimes he passes for the property of John Jant, of S. Carolina; he is an artful, sagacious fellow, and among negroes talks very loud.  He will no doubt pass for a free man.  Took with him, a tolerable second hand broad cloth brown coat and striped pantaloons.  Any person taking said Negro, and securing him in any gaol, shall receive the above reward, and all reasonable charges paid it brought home.  It is supposed he has a gun with him.<BR>GEO[George] SMITH<BR>October 20 1807
