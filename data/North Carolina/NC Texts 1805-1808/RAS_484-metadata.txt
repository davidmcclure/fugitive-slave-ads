Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR> RUN away from the Subscriber, on Saturday, the 25th ult. a negro man named TONY, by trade a blacksmith. He is about 24 years of age, 4 feet 9 or 10 inches high, and very yellow. One of his feet (I believe the right one) has been broken a little below the instep, from a fall a straining a horse, which causes him to limp considerably. He carried off with a him a variety of clothes, amongst which was a darker new surtout coat; and has, I have reason to believe, a good deal of pocket money with him. His aim, no doubt is some of the Northern states. He sometimes plays on the fiddle. I will give the above reward and all reasonable reward and all reasonable expences, if brought home to me, or confined in any goal so that I get him again.<BR> John Walker.<BR>Plymouth, Jan. 2, 1808.  tf93<BR>Since I arrived in this place, I have been informed by the stage driver, that he took up the above fellow on the road, between this and Suffolk, who he conceived, from his colour and appearance, was free-born. He passed by the name of BENJAMIN JAMES, and said he was from Newbern, where he had worked at the silver-smiths's business; but finding little employ, he was determined to try some part of the Northward. He passed as a passenger in the stage, and stopped at the different inns, until he arrived within a small distance of Suffolk, when the stage-driver dropt him. <BR> J.W. <BR>Edenton, Jan 4. 1808.
