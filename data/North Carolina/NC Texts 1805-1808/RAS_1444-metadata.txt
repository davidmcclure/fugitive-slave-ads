Is like to be very bulky when he gets his growth.  I expect he will try to pass for a free man, if he can get out of this neighbourhood; he is the property of Samuel Johnston, Esq. of Martin county.  All persons are cautioned from concealing or carrying him off--The above reward will be paid to any person securing him so that he may be had.<BR>Stephen Sharrock.
