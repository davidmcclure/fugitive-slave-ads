Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward, <BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber about three weeks ago, a Mulatto Fellow named BOB, twenty-five years old, fully six feet high and well made; has long black hair--two of his upper fore teeth gone--Stut[t]ers when spoken to, and when frightened stammers so much that he can scarcely be understood--a carpenter by trade. I apprehend he has procured a forged pass, and may attempt to pass as a freeman. He has been seen about Wilmington where he has a mother, & where he may harboured.<BR>All persons are forewarned from harbouring, employing or carrying said fellow away under the severest penalty of the law. The above reward will be paid for securing him in jail so that I get him again, or delivering him at my plantation on the Northeast.<BR>Wm. Davis.<BR>New-Haonver County, <BR>Sept. 16th, 1806.
