Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY on Wednesday the 17th instant, a bright Mulatto Fellow named TOM, five feet 6 or 7 inches high and well set, 18 or 19 years of age, has the mark of an Anchor done with Indian Ink on his right wrist, a scar over his right eye and another on the lower part of his neck, the latter occasioned by a burn; and formerly belonged to a Mr. Davis or South Carolina. He is very artful, and no doubt will attempt to get off by sea or land, under pretence of being free; all persons are therefore forewarned against harbouring, employing or carrying him away. The above reward will be paid for putting him in jail, so that I get him again, and in addition thereto, all reasonable expences in bringing him to me in Wilmington.<BR>HENRY B. HOWARD.<BR>Sept. 23.
