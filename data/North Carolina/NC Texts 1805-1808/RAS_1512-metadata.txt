Transcript: RAN AWAY from the subscriber in Wake County, North-Carolina, on the 9th of March 1805, a Negro Man about 22 years of age by the name of TAPLEY, who will pass for a freeman and I expect will alter his name. I was informed by a Negro Man of Isham Blakes in Fayetteville, that he has seen him frequently on the River between Fayetteville and Wilmington and in Wilmington, and that the said Runaway had been several voyages to the West-Indies in some of the Wilmington vessels, and is now supposed to be about Wilmington.  He and Mr. Blake's Negro being long acquainted was the reason of his going down that course. The said Negro may be known by a nice examination, on the chin may be seen a small scar, and I have heard since he left me that his leg was broke when was small; he is a tall well built mulatto fellow, it was supposed that a white man was his father, was born and raised in Orange couny in this state. Any person who will take up the said fellow & confine him in any jail so that I get him, shall be well rewarded by me.<BR>George Herndon.<BR>October 10.   3w
