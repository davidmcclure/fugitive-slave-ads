Transcript: RUN AWAY<BR>A NEGRO FELLOW, named KINGSON, who is well known in this and several of the adjacent Counties, where he has attended for several years with Cakes; but as I expect he will go where he has never been before, it is necessary to describe him.  He is about five feet eight or ten inches high, thirty years old, dark complexion, stout made, smiling countenance when he speaks, his nose wide at the nostrils and sharp at the end, and one of his upper teeth broken half off.<BR>He went to Franklin Court, at Louisburg, on Monday the 14th instant, with a Cake-Cart and two Horses.  From thence he went off on Tuesday night, taking one of the Horses, a dark bay, about four feet ten inches high, five years old, his left eye entirely out, his right ear slit about two inches down from the point.  he trots and gallops rough.<BR>Kingston had on when he went from home, a fine blue Cloth Coat, and has other good Cloaths with him.<BR>I suppose he may have obtained a Pass or Certificate from some person of his being free, and that he will change is name.<BR>Any person delivering me the Negro and Horse, shall receive SEVENTY DOLLARS, and have all reasonable Expences paid; and Twenty Dollars for the Horse.<BR>DORCAS TANNER<BR>Warren County, N C Sep 22.
