Transcript: ADVERTISEMENT.<BR> RUN away from the Subscriber, on the 18th instant, a negro man named DOLPHUS. He is generally known in this county, and in the Town of Edenton. He is a large clumsy black looking fellow, stoops in his shoulders, walks sluggish and clumsy, has some scars on his face, and two of his upper fore-teeth stands inward. He had on when he went off a new white homespun kersey jacket, and white woolen trowers[sic], singlewove, a new tow shirt, and some other clothes that I am not acquainted with, together with a new wool hat. He pretends to be a carpenter, but knows nothing of the business, is very trifling at any thing he undertakes.--Any person that will apprehend the said negro fellow Dolphus, and deliver him to me, or confine him in gaol in the county. I will give a reward of 8 Dollars: If taken in any other county in the state, and confined as above, so that I get the negro, a reward of 10 Dollars will be given.<BR> Joshua Skinner.<BR>N.B.  Dolphus is a very bad disposed negro, and went off without any provocation. <BR>Perquimans, Jan. 19, 1808.   2w101
