Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR> RUN away on the 14th inst. a NEGRO MAN by the name of JACOB, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, and about 28 or 29 years old, thought of a much younger appearance; short and thick, well made, dark complexion, commonly wears his hair tied and cued, his feet in--or much parrot-toed. Had on when he went away, a woollen Jacket and Trowsers[sic], dyed a purple colour; no other clothes with him. He has a wife at the house where George Bains, jun. dec[deceased], formerly lived and another belonging to W. Littlejohn, Esq.[Esquire] near Edenton, where he is most likely to be sculking about; he has been branded on the cheeks I.S. but the letters cannot be distinctly seen, though some appearance of the burn--also, one of his heel-strings has been cut, which is now visible. He has a strong desire for some time to go to sea, and may attempt to get on board some vessel for that purpose. I will give the above reward to any person that will deliver him to me, or confine him in goal, so that I get him. All masters of vessels and others are forwarned harbouring or employing him, under the penalty of the law.<BR>JAS.[James] SUTTON.<BR> February 23d, 1806.   3t 9
