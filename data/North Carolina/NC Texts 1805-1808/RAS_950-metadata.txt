Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away last Sunday, from Johnston county, near Baff's ferry, a Negro man named BOB, about 20 years of age--clothed rather indifferent--one of his knees has been hurt, or has had the white swelling, which is readily discovered in his walk.  I purchased him from a certain Benjamin W. Johnson, who lives at the Cross Keys in Southampton, state of Virginia and am told told[sic] that he formerly belonged to some of the Nichols's, on the Three Creeks : where I expect he will try to go, and pass as a freeman.<BR>I will give the above reward on delivery of the said Negro to me, in Pitt County, or if taken up without the limits of this state, thirty dollars besides reasonable expences ; or if secured in any jail, so that I get him again, a liberal reward.<BR>BENJ[BENJAMIN] ATKINSON.<BR>April 5--(2d)
