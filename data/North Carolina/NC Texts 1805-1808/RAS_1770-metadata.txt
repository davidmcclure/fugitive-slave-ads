Transcript: RUNAWAYS<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on the night of the 18th inst a Negro man slave, with his wife and a girl child eight months old.  The fellow's name is Charles--he was formerly called Lewis: he is a yellow fellow, and may be taken for a mulatto, trim and well made, of a middling stature; has a thick, bushy head of hair, and about twenty six years of age, had on when he went away a jacket and breeches of yellow homespun, and carried other clothes with him.  He may be noted by a large lump on one of his shins (perhaps the left) occasioned by his once having a sore leg.  He was brought to Duplin county, from the neighborhood at Norfleet's ferry, on Roanoke river, in Northampton county, about five years ago, by a Mr. David Cannon, from whom I purchased him; but who his former master was I do not particularly recollect.<BR>Charles's wife is quite a young wench, and very likely, of a low stature and rather thick made.  She is known by the name of Kity and has a remarkable mark on one of her cheeks, occasioned by a burn when a child.  She was also well clothed, in striped homespun cloth, and had likewise other clothes with her.  They will in all probability endeavor to make for Roanoke again, and perhaps get in some neighborhood where there may be free Negroes, and try to pass as free also.  Whoever will deliver the said Negroes, or either of them, to me, four miles from Duplin court house, or secure them in any jail, so that I get them, shall receive a full compensation proportionate to their time and the trouble they may be at.<BR>Alexander Dickson.<BR>Duplin county, Nov. 25 1805.   3w
