Transcript: $10 Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 15th inst. negro boy<BR>ISAAC,<BR>Well known in Tarborough as the property of Mrs. Manie Joyner, formerly of that place. Isaac, though grown, is much under the ordinary height and size--well formed, active, and very black. He was last year hired by Mr. Howard, and I believe worked in the office of the Tarborough Press. He has or had a wife at D. Lawrence's plantation near Tarborough, where I feel assured he has gone. I will pay Ten Dollars for his delivery in the jail at Tarborough, upon receiving information from the Jailor to that effect.<BR>B.A. POPE.<BR>Weldon, N.C. Augt. 18, 1838.
