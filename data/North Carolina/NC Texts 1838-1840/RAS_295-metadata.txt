Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, about the 22d of June, a negro man named HAYWOOD: he is about 26 years old, five feet eight inches high, stout built and black complexion-his articulation is a little difficult, and when addressed he appears quite humble. It is understood that he had been seen in Newbern, and he is probably lurking about that place or in the neighbourhod of Swift Creek. All persons, and Masters of vessels particularly, are forewarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law, which will certainly be enforced against those who violate its provisions. The above reward will be paid for apprehending and delivering him to the subscriber, or for securing him in jail.<BR>DANIEL GASKINS.<BR>Swift Creek, Craven co. 20th July, 1838.}
