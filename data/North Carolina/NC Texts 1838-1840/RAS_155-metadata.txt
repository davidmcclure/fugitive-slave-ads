Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on last Saturday night, a very bright mulatto Boy by the name of WARNER, about five feet two inches in height, nineteen years of age, spare made, strait black hair, black eyes, genteel in his appearance, very polite in his manners, speaks quick, and is somewhat conceited, has small scars on the back of one of his hands and is freckled under his eyes; it is possible that he may have by some means, obtained free papers.  He took with him two suits of clothes one of gray broadcloth, frock coat and pantaloons, the other of homespun coperas color, roundabout and pantaloons, and a black fur hat, about half worn.  It requires close inspection to distinguish him from a white person.  It is supposed that he has gone in the direction of Lynchburg, or Hillsborough, or down the river.<BR>I will give the above reward if taken over twenty miles from home; over ten miles and within twenty, $30; within ten miles, $16, if he is returned to me or lodged in jail so that I get him again.<BR>NATHL. P. THOMAS.<BR>Near Milton, N.C.<BR>July 10  80--tf
