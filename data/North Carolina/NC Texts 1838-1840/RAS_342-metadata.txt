Transcript: $25 Reward<BR>MY NEGRO BILL, sometimes called BILL WYATT, ranaway from me last June in Wake Forest, and I have reasons to think, is now in Raleigh or its vicinity.  Bill has had his left arm cut off near his elbow, is a bright Mulatto, about 45 years of age, and is well known about the City of Raleigh.  I expect he will pass as a free man, if he has left his old range.  The above reward will be given for apprehending Bill, and securing him in any Jail in the State of North-Carolina.<BR>THOMAS MILLER.<BR>Granville, Jan. 31, 1839.     14
