Transcript: $50 REWARD.<BR>My negro man ALLEN left my premises, 6 miles south of Roxboro', on Saturday night the 30th of March, 1839. ALLEN is about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high; has a scar on one of his cheeks, not recollected which, that can be easily discovered when his beard is off; he has also a small scar on his breast--he has also a scar on his hip and small of his back, from an accidental burn when a boy, he is about 32 years of age, tolerably stout, and black complexion, tho'[though] not of the darkest negro shade.
