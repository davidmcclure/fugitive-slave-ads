Transcript: $10 REWARD<BR>FOR the arrest and delivery of OLD JIM, (known by the name of Jim Oaks,) who ran away on Monday night last, or Five Dollars will be paid for his arrest and confinement. He stole and took away with him a set of Carpenter and Waggon[sic] making tools, and from what I can learn will endeaver to sell said tools in order to obtain cash to defray travelling expenses. I will give ten dollars for information that will lead to the conviction of any person or persons who have traded for or conceals said tools, and who may harbor or aid him in absconding. Said negro belonged formerly to Oaks' estate of Davie county, was brought to this place by Mr. Jas.[James] McComb. He has been in the habit of staying in the neighborhood of Mr. John Means' in Cabarras county, and perhaps will return there again or make for his old neighborhood in Davie county; description of size and appearance is needless from the fact of his being as notorious a character and far famed for ingenious villany.<BR>JOHN M. HAPPOLDT.<BR>Charlotte, Sept. 25, 1838.<BR>417tf.
