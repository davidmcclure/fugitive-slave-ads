Transcript: 100 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the first of this month, a small Mulatto Woman by the name of Milly, aged about 25 or 26 years, with quite a bushy head of hair, and a flat nose, quite a small appearance about the breast, speaks quite mild when spoken to, and a quick step. She is a good seamstress and knitter for a Negro. No other particular marks recollected; went off well clothed.<BR>I suspected her of robbing my Trunk of $700 a few days before, and will give the above reward for the woman and money, or in proportion to what my be found with her; if none, a liberal reward for her. She may try to pass as a free woman, and perhaps she may have a pass, or some one may have taken her off with the money and sold her.<BR>E. LOVE.<BR>Rockingham, Richmond county, Jan. 10. 80tf
