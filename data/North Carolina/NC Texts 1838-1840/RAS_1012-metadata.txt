Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN away, on the night of the 31st ultimo, a negro man named LEWIS, five feet 10 or 11 inches high, very stout built, would probably weigh 180. Inclined to be knock-kneed, his face full of bumps or pimples, aged about 33, speaks low when talking.  He had a white and black hat, and both boots and shoes but not known which he wore.  He also had four new shirts, a light coloured handkerchief--the remnant of a counterpane.  He is believed to have with him a watch and a pocket organ.<BR>Also, on the same night, a negro man named CHARLES, about 33 years of age; very black, his eyes rather sunk in his head, spare built--particularly narrow through the lips, and speaks low.  No particular marks recollected, except a small mark on one side of his nose, and one or two on his face, which will not be observed without close inspection.  Charles had nankin pants, and an old dove colored cloth coat, and boots, --his other clothing not recollected.  He plays on the fiddle.<BR>Lewis and Charles are intelligent negroes, and will probably endeavor to get to a free State.  They may have passes with them, and call themselves free.<BR>A reward of twenty-five dollars each will be given to any person who will return them to the subscribers, or confine them in any jail so that we get them again.<BR>Any information about these runaways will be thankfully received.  Address either of the subscribers, at Haw River post-office, Orange county, North Carolina.<BR>JOHN ROGERS,<BR>,MARTHA FREELAND.<BR>September 4  68--2w
