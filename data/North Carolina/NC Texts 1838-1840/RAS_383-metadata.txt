Transcript: $50 REWARD--RANAWAY from the subscriber about the first of January last, four negroes, to wit: a negro fellow, CALVIN, a bright mulatto, about twenty-five years of age, about five feet five or six inches high, rather stout, he has small spots on his face resembling the pustules occasioned by the small pox, he has a down cast look but when spoken to speaks rather quick, he can write a legible hand and he has a brother that can write a very good hand. The probability is, he has obtained a free pass and may be trying to pass as a free man, where he is not known, or may be endeavoring to get to some free State.<BR>MICHAEL, is a negro woman about thirty years of age, rather dark mulatto, and has a very bold and masculine countenance. She carried off a child, MARY, about twelve months of age, the child could walk when she left.<BR>LEVIL, is a bright mulatoo about seventeen years of age, she has a very pleasing countenance, speaks mildly when in common conversation--in short, the above negroes are all of one family.<BR>It is expected they are lurking about Robert W. McKinn's, in Johnson County, where all their relations live, or about the cross roads, in Wayne County, near James Everitt, Silas Case, and others, where they were raised.<BR>The above reward will be given for the delivery of the negroes to me, or their being confined in Jail so that I get them again.<BR>JAMES MCKINN, Guardian.<BR>Waynesborough [Goldsboro], May 16, 1838.    185-tf.<BR>The Editors of the Fayettevill[e] Journal, Wilmington Advertiser and Newbern Spectator, will insert till forbid and send their accounts to the office of the N.C. Standard.
