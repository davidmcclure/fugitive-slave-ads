Transcript: RUNAWAY from the Subscriber on the 4th January last, my negro woman LUCY, aged between 35 and 40 years.  It is probable that said negro is lurking about Raleigh or Mr. Jack Hutching's Plantation, where her husband is now living.  She is dark complected, and no doubt goes finely dressed.<BR>ALSO, on the 8th inst., a negro girl WINCY. Said negro is 19 years old, dark complected, and wore when she left me a check cotton frock. She has a mother residing in the vicinity of Raleigh, where she has no doubt gone.<BR>I will give $4 for each of the negroes if caught within this State, or $10 if out of it.<BR>RICHARD J. HOPKINS<BR>Wakefield [Raleigh], Wake county, N.C>    238 3t.
