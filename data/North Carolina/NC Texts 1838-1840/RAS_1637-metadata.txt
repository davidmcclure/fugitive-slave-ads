Charles is of low stature, black complexion, and somewhat cross-eyed. Juno is of a brighter complexion, rather stout built, and has a scar by the side of her nose, occasioned by a burn. They are about fifty years of age. It is supposed that they have obtained a pass, and are aiming for Bladen county, where Juno's former master (John Lucas) resided. A reward of Twenty Dollars will be given for their delivery to me, or confinement in any Jail so that I get them again.<BR>JOHN HEADEN.<BR>November 7, 1839.<BR>71-4w
