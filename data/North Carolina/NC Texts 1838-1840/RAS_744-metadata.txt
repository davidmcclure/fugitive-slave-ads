Transcript: 300 DOLLARS<BR>REWARD.<BR>ABSCONDED from the subscriber, living in Anson county, on the 21st inst., a stout likely negro boy named SAM, about 20 years of age, dark complexion and has a scar on his forehead and one on one of his shoulders caused by a burn, he has a pleasing countenance when spoken to and keeps his eyes half shut--he has been but little from home and is not very bright or polite and has a strong course voice, he had on a brown sattinet coat, white flax pantaloons and spotted vest, nearly white, black hat with a very narrow brim. It is believed from some suspicious persons passing through Anson about that time, that the said negro has been stolen or enticed off. The persons suspected travelled in a small carryall painted yellow with one horse, and one of the persons riding another and sometimes leading a third and sometimes running loose--one of the horses was an iron grey with a blazed face, also a dark ches[t]nut sorrel mare, the other a pale sorrel horse, blazed face and white hind legs, a very fine animal. These persons stated that they were going to Cheraw to sell Bacon and Flour, they then changed their course and went towards Fayetteville, stating that these articles were so low in Cheraw they were going to Fayetteville for a better market, they again changed and went in the direction of Salisbury. It is suspected that these persons crossed Haley's Ferry on Pee Dee after night as it was late when they went in that direction, as they stopped at a house late to buy corn, and the boy, who was at this house stated to the negroes that as he was going to Covington's plantation he wanted to cross the Ferry at the same time they did--and from the statement of the ferryman they must have put themselves across during the night--since which time the boy has not been heard of. It is expected they will aim for the South or West. The above reward will be paid for the two men, or $100 for either of them, if taken with the negro in their possession so as to lead to their conviction, or $100 for the negro boy if taken up and secured in any jail so that I can get him.<BR>WILLIAM RATLIFF.<BR>July 26, 1839.<BR>t463<BR>Editors to the South and West will confer a favor on the public by noticing the above.
