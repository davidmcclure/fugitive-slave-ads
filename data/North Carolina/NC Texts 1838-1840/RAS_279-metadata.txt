Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>I will give the above reward for the apprehension and confinement in Jail, or the same and pay all reasonable expenses, for the delivery to me, of negro man WESTON who ranaway on Sunday last. He is a stout-built mullatto[sic], with a round full face, about twenty-three years of age, and is a sensible fellow. Rail road and stage against are requested to be on the alert, as he may have procured free papers and will probably attempt to avail himself of their mode of conveyance to escape from the State.<BR>FABIUS J. HAYWOOD.<BR>Raleigh, Feb 26, 1839.<BR>10tf
