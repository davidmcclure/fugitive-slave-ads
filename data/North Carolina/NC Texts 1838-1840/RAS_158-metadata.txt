Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 25th of October, a negro man named ROBBIN, about 45 years old, five feet 8 or 10 inches high, dark complected and heavy made, has on his right hand some severe scars, having been torn by a Cotton Gin. He is a shrewd smart fellow and no doubt will endeavor to get in with some white man to assist him along. I think it probable he will make for Ohio or Indiana. The above reward will be given for apprehending and securing him in any goal[sic] without the State so that I get him, and Fifty Dollars if taken within the State.<BR>LEWIS DINKINS.<BR>Nov. 4, 1839.<BR>7tf
