Transcript: $20 REWARD, Runaway or Stolen, from the Subscriber, on the 27th of last month, a negro woman and two children; the woman is tall and black, and a few days before she went off, I burnt her with a hot iron on the left side of her face; I tried to make the letter M, and she kept a cloth over her head and face and a fly bonnet on her head, so as to cover the burn, she has a very wide vacancy between her upper fore teeth; her children are both boys; the oldest one is in his seventh year; he is a mulatto; he has blue eyes; the youngest is black; he is in his fifth year, he is cock'eyed, inclined to be cross eyed. The woman's name is Bettey, commonly called Bet. The oldest boy's name is Burrel and the other ones name is Gray. The above reward of 20 dollars will be given to any person that will deliver the said negroes to me.  It is probable they may attempt to pass as free.<BR>MICAJAH RICKS.<BR>Nash County, July 7th, 1838.    193-3t.
