Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber's plantation, in Onslow county, about the eighth of last month, two negro men, HERCULES and SOLOMON. Hercules was raised in Johnston county, by Edmund Johnston, dec'd[deceased], and sold by the Administrator in December last in the town of Smithfield, and purchased by me at said sale. He is of rather dark complexion, though not black, aged about twenty years, and from five feet six to eight inches high, stout and well made for strength. He is no doubt lurking about in the county where he was raised. Solomon was raised in Wake county, and purchased by me at the sale of Bennet T. Blake, on the 21st of December last. He is of light complexion, though not mulatto, aged about twenty two years, and about five feet eight to ten inches high, of ordinary size. He is no doubt lurking about in Wake county. I will give the above reward of fifty dollars for the apprehension and confinement in the Jail at Smithfield, for the two negroes, so that I get them again, or twenty-five dollars for either one of them. Any person apprehending one or both of said negroes will please address John J. Faro, French's Mills, Onslow county, N. C., who has charge of my business and will attend to the matter.<BR>DANIEL L. RUSSELL.<BR>July 16, 1838<BR>30 6w
