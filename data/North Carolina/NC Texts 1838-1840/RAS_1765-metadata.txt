Transcript: RUNAWAY<BR>FROM the Subscriber, residing in Granville County, N.C. on the 30th day of August last, a negro man by the name of JORDAN, and his wife JANE.<BR>Jordan is a common size fellow, light black, large full eyes, has a down look when spoken to, the 4th finger on his right hand has grown crooked, by means of a cut.  He carried with him wearing apparel and bed clothes; among them is a suit of dark yarn jeans homespun cloth.  He wore off a pair of lined and bound right and left shoes, nearly new.  The woman is a little under common size, and is in a pregnant state.  She carried with her a purple circassion[circassian] dress, a white dress, a dark grounded calico dress, and some home made clothes.  I believe the said negroes were seduced off by some infamous character, and they will attempt to pass for free negroes.  I will give ten dollars for their delivery or confinement in Jail, in Granville or Wake, or twenty dollars if out of such counties, and thirty dollars for the detection and conviction of any white person who has assisted them in getting off.<BR>CLEMENT WILKINS.<BR>Star, 3 times--C.W.<BR>Sept. 10, 1838    45--3t
