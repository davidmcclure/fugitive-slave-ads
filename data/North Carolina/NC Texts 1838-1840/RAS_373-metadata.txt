Transcript: $5 REWARD.<BR>LEFT the subscriber, living in Providence Settlement, on the 24th instant, a negro woman named MARIA, between 25 and 30 years of age. She is a likely smart wench, and when spoken to, generally smiles, her front teeth is out, she has a small scar on her face, very black complected and had on when she left a cotton frock and took with her some other clothes.
