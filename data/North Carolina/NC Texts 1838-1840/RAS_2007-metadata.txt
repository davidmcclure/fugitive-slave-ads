Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR> My mulatto man BEN absented himself on the 12th inst. without any known cause, carrying with him several blankets and a quantity of common clothing. Ben is a bright mulatto, about 24 years old, straight and stout made, about five feet high, speaks quick when questioned, and looks extremely daring. He has a hoarseness, which makes him speak loud at times, as though he had a cold. I know not where he may be; but as his father, David Jarman, a free man, lives on Stone's bay, he may lurk about that neighbourhood, or may endeavor to get on board of some vessel to make his way to a free State. All those who have charge of vessles will please be mindful of the law. I will give the above reward of twenty five dollars to any person who will apprehend the said boy and confine him so that I get him.<BR>BUCKNER BOUSE.<BR>Onslow County, 17th, May 1839.
