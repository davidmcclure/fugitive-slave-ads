Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on Wednesday night last, my negro woman<BR>CHANEY,<BR>Aged about 40 years, slender built, bright mulatto--about the sight of one of her eyes she has a white speck. Chaney took with her, her three children--MARY, aged 11 or 12 years, mahogany color--LAZARUS, aged about 4 years, bright mulatto, nearly white--and TOM, about 2 years old, mulatto color. I have been informed, that Godwin Cotten's Eli has of late frequently visited Chaney, and in all probability will assist her in getting to a free State. The above reward will be given for the apprehension of Chaney and her three children, if delivered to me near Falkland, Pitt county, N C. or if confined in any jail so that I get them again. All persons are forbid harboring or carrying off said negroes under penalty of the law.<BR>JOSIAH BARRETT.<BR>March 15, 1839.<BR>11<BR>The Norfolk Herald will please insert until otherwise directed.
