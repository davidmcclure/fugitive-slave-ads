Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>Ranaway from the subscriber, on the 29th ult. a negro man named HILL, about twenty-five years old, of dark complexion, from five feet eight to ten inches high; speaks quick when spoken to. He wore away a green close bombazine coat, and fured[sic] hat; and he has a cloak with him. I have thought it possible that he may have gone to Orange county where he has a brother, recently carried there by Edward Ward, formerly of Onslow; or if he has not, I am induced to believe that his object is to get to a free State. I will give the above reward of fifty dollars for his apprehension and confinement in Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>DANIEL L. RUSSELL.<BR>Onslow County, 11th January, 1840.<BR>4 5w
