Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR> RUN AWAY from the subscriber his man ROBIN, who absconded about the 28th of last month without any cause whatever, and it is believed he will endeavour to make his way to the State of Ohio. Robin is a tolerable bright mulatto about six feet high; a stout muscular man, aged about 42 years; has one fore tooth missing, or a wide space between his fore teeth; has a scar on one of his cheek bones, occasioned by a burn when young, and the mark of a severe cut on one of his thumbs; he is very fond of spirits, and when drunk, is very outrageous. Robin has worked in a Tan yard for 20 years, and is a very good Tanner and Currier. He is also a good coarse Shoe Maker, and carried away his tools with him.<BR> I will give the above reward for the apprehension and confinement in jail of Robin, so that I get him again. Any person apprehending said negro, will please address to me at Oxford, North Carolina.<BR>JNO.[JOHN] B. LITTLEJOHN.<BR>Oxford, 5th, Sept. 1839.   14:tf
