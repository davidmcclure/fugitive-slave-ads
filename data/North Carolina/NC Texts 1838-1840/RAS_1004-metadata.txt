Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>Ranaway from the Subscriber's plantation in Bertie county on the 10th of August, a negro man by the name of DREW, he is of dark complexion though not black, aged about 33 years, has no very notable marks recollected, more than he has lost the two front under teeth, is about five feet six or eight inches high. He was purchased at the sale of William Alston, in Warren county, about twenty-five or six years past. I am under the impression that said boy is lurking about the neighborhood of Shady Grove, in said county, as he has relations there, or in the neighborhood of one of the Mr. Eaton's who lives in Warren, perhaps near the Roanoke. I understand that his mother of the boy is named Aggy. She was also purchased from the estate of William Alston.--I will give the above reward of fifty dollars for apprehending said boy and delivering him to me, or twenty dollars if confined in Jail so that I get him again.<BR>SAMUEL WILLIAMS.<BR>Martin County, N. C. Sept. 14, 1838,<BR>44 7tp
