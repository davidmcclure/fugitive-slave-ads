Transcript: $30 REWARD.--I will give the above reward of Thirty Dollars to any person who will apprehend and deliver to me, or confine in jail so that I can get him, my negro man TOM, who ran away from me about 9th of February last. TOM is about forty-two or forty-three years old, about five feet five or six inches high, rather light built, of light complexion, almost of the Indian order, lank or hollow jawed, wears his half combed up in front, when spoken to has a down look; no particular mark recollected, except a scar from a severe cut on his right fore finger. It is believed he has with him Free Papers belonging to James Lucas or Locust, who froze to death in January last in the neighborhood : since which his Free Papers have not been found or heard of; and I have no doubt TOM is now passing himself as James Lucas or Locust as a free man. I have reason to believe that he is occasionally lurking about Louisburg, as I bought him of Mr. JOSIAH BRIDGES of that vicinity.<BR>All perosns are cautioned against employing, harboring, carrying away, or assisting him to get away, as the law will in every case be rigidly enforced.<BR>RICHARD SHORT.<BR>Vicksville P.O., Nash county, N.C.} August 21, 1839}  253-tf
