Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 14th. inst., a negro fellow named<BR>LOT;<BR>he is about 25 years of age, five feet seven or eight inches high, well made, thick set, dark copper colour, has rather a fine voice, is very likely, has several scars on his feet, occasioned by cuts of axes, and had on, when he left, a suit of dark woollen cloathes, nearly new.  It is believed that LOT will be found lurking about Newbern, as he has relations in that place, and will probably make an attempt to get to the North in some vessel.  All persons are forewarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law, which will certainly be enforced against those who violate its provisions in such case made and provided.  The above Reward will be paid to any person for lodging him in any jail in this State, so that I get him, and all reasonable charges, in addition to the above, for delivering him to me in Jones county.<BR>AMOS L. SIMMONS.<BR>Jones County, 16th May, 1840.--595 tf.
