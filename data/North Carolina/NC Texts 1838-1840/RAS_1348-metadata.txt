Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, living in Granville county, N. Carolina, on the 24th inst. a negro man named PETER. He is about 30 or 35 years old; rather low; of dark complexion (tho'[though] not very black;) has a bushy head of hair, thick lips and a grum look (except when he smiles or laughs) and a scar on his neck, occasioned by an attempt to cut his own throat when a boy, many years before he came into my possession. He took with him very little, if any clothing, besides what he had on, which consisted of a winter roundabout made of domestic cloth (part wool & part cotton,) white cotton shirt and pantaloons.<BR>From the slightness of the provocation which he received from my overseer, together with other circumstances, I am sure that he intends to make his way to some free State. Perhaps he may attempt to travel in the Rail Road cars a free man, or in company with some incendiary? as his property. He has no doubt a free pass, and may possibly make his way through the country north west towards the State of Ohio, Indiana or Illinois. Another negroe[sic] man in the neighborhood ran away the same day. They may be in company. I will give the above reward of thirty dollars for his apprehension and delivery, or confinement in any jail in this State, so that I get him again; and forty dollars, if taken up out of the State, confined in jail, and notice given me, so that I get him.<BR>JOSIAH CRUDUP.<BR>May 27, 1839.<BR>23 3w<BR>The Greensboro' Patriot and Milton Spectator will please publish three times and forward their accounts to the subscriber at Haysville.<BR>J. C.
