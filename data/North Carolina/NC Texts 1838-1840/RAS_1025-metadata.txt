Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension and delivery to me or for securing in jail so that I get him, ANTONY, who left me the last of July: I think it highly probable that he is lurking about Newbern, as he was raised by a Mr. Hancock, & that place. Antony is about six feet high, stout in proportion, has some scars about his ancles[sic], I believe, and is a fine looking negro.
