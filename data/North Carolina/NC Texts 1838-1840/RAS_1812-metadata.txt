Transcript: STOP THE RUNAWAY.<BR>RUNAWAY from the Subscriber, living within a mile and an[sic] half of Wakefield, Wake County, on the 6th of September, his negro girl<BR>WINCY.<BR>Said negro is about 21 years of age, tolerably dark complected, four feet, four or five inches high, walks with her toes turned inward, and is very pert when spoken to.
