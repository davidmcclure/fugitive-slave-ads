Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward. <BR>  RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on Friday the 17th ultimo, negro woman ROXANA, aged about 35 years. She has large white eyes, a rough, husky face, a mole under her chin, and has lost all her upper front teeth except two which are much decayed. She is probably lurking about the plantation of Mr. Jno.[John] Charlton, on Core Creek, Craven County, where she has a husband, and a great many acquaintances: she is also well acquainted in Newbern and in Kinston, where she has several relations. I will give the above reward for the apprehension and delivery of the above named slave to me in Trenton, or for securing her in any jail in the State so that I get her. I hereby forwarn all persons from employing, harbouring or carrying her away, under the penalty of the law. <BR>  W. L. B. PEARCE. <BR>  Trenton, 15th Dec. 1837. 486tf
