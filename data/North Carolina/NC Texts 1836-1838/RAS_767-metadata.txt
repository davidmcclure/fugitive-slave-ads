Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR> ABSCONDED from the subscriber on the 3rd of August last, a negro girl named EMILY, about 18 or 20 years of age, of common height, slender form, and rather light complexion. She took with her a variety of clothing, among which was a calico frock and another of striped domestick cloth. Emily has relations in Newbern, among the slavery of Isaac Taylor, Esq.[Esquire] and also on Core Creek, in Craven County, and is probably concealed in the neighborhood of one those places. <BR> The above reward will be given for apprehension and delivery to me, or for her confinement in any jail so that I get her, besides the reimbursement of any reasonable expense that may be incurred in her apprehension. <BR> B. COLEMAN,<BR>Elm Grove, Dec. 18th, 1836.
