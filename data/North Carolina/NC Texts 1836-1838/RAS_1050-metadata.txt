Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>Ranaway from the subscriber, on the 8th day of April 1837, in Randolph county, N. Carolina, a negro man by the name of ANTHONY, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high; light made, on the yellow order, with a mole on the left side of his chin. He can read very well. He carried away with him about two hundred dollars in silver, I have no doubt but he will try to pass for a free man. The said boy is about 30 years old. His wife was taken to Columbus, Mississippi, by John Goodwin; and I think he has gone there, or to some free State. He will no doubt alter his name. He sometimes called himself Anthony Goodwin, and sometimes Anthony Thomas. I will give twenty-five dollars to any person who will take him up and confine  him in jail so that I can get him; or fifty dollars to deliver him to me at Vicarage, Randolph co. N. C. Please address at Vicarage post office, Randolph county, North Carolina.<BR>JESSE BRAY.<BR>Vicarage, Randolph, Oct. 15, 1837[?]. 43[?] [illegible]
