Transcript: RANAWAY<BR> From the subscriber on the 14th inst. three negro boys, CARY, HENRY, and ALEXANDER Cary is about 22 years of age, light complected about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, no marks recollected. Henry is of a dark complexion and has a scar on his forehead, and is about 5 feet 10 inches high. Alexander is very black, has a slight scar on his face occasioned by a fall from a horse, and is about 5 feet 8 inches high. I will give FIFTY dollars reward for the apprehension of said negroes and delivery in any jail in the United States, so that I can get them. All the boys can read and write tolerably well, and it is likely they may have free passes and will try to make their way to some free State. <BR>MOSES CHAMBERS.<BR>Person county, N.C. June 20, 1837.--33-4
