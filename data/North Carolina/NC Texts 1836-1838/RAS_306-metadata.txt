Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber in Caswell county, on the 25th of September last, a Negro man named VIRGIL. Said Negro was purchased of Maj. Charles L. Hinton, of Wake county, and is supposed to be lurking about the neighborhood of Major Hinton, where he is well known.  Whoever may apprehend said Negro will confine him in Wake Jail, or deliver him to Mr. Alexander Campbell, of Raleigh.<BR>HENRY WILLIS.<BR>Nov. 5, 1836.    48<BR>P.S. VIRGIL carried off with him a very valuable DOG, for the restoration of which alone I will give a Reward of TEN DOLLARS.  He is a very full, yellow Dog, with a tail six or eight inches long, and quite fierce.  His bark is loud and terrific.  He has been beaten over the head and his nose seems as if it had been broken-- Information either of the Negro or the Dog, will be thankfully received, and the Reward cheerfully paid, on application as above.<BR>H.W.
