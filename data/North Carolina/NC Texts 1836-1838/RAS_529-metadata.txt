Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 10th instant, my Negro Man JACOB, about twenty-four years of age; 3 feet 8 or 9 inches high, stout made, will weigh 170 or 180 lbs.  Jacob has a large head, big mouth, thick lips and very black : he can do tolerable work as a blacksmith, and he understands blasting of rock very well.  He went off without any cause; I therefore believe he has procured a Pass.  I wish any person taking him up to examine him for said Pass and have it preserved, as I wish to prosecute the person who would be guilty of such an act.<BR>J. WILLIAMS<BR>Surry county, N. Carolina}<BR>Jan. 26, 1837}<BR>13 5t p
