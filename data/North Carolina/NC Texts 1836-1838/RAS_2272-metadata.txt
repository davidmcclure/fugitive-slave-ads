Transcript: Runaways.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber on the 2d of June last, my negro man RICHARD, about twenty eight years of age. He is dark complexioned, rather low and well set, limps a little when walking, and has a small scar over one if not both of his eyes. He is probably lurking about the Sound and Wilmington, where most of his relatives reside. He is legally outlawed. And a reward of TWENTY FIVE dollars will be paid for his apprehension dead or alive. Satisfactory proof will only be required of his being killed. If taken alive, and confined in jail, or delivered to me at Richlands, Onslow county, all reasonable expenses[sic] will be paid in addition to the reward.--He has with him in all probability, his wife ELIZA, who ran away from Col. Thompson, now a resident of Alabama. She eloped from her master about the time he commenced his journey to that State. I will give a reward of FIFTEEN DOLLARS for her apprehension and delivery to me, or for having her safely confined in any jail, so that I get her.<BR>DURAN H. RHODES.<BR>Richlands, Dec. 12th, 1837.<BR>101 tf.
