Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on Wednesday last, the 14th inst. my negro man,<BR>JACK,<BR>Aged about 36 or 37 years, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches in height, dark complexion, stout built, and a very likely and intelligent fellow--he generally goes well dressed, and has no doubt a considerable sum of money with him. Jack has a father living as a free man at Mr. Clark's plantation in Scotland Neck, and he probably may be lurking in that vicinity, or may be turning his course towards Plymouth, as he has heretofore been boating[?] on the Roanoke--or, he may be making his way to the free States. The above reward will be paid for his apprehension and delivery to me in Edgecombe county, N.C. or if secured in any jail so that I get him again. All persons are cautioned against harboring or carrying off said fellow under penalty of the law.<BR>GABRIEL PURVIS.<BR>Feb. 16, 1838.<BR>The Norfolk Herald will please insert the above until otherwise directed.
