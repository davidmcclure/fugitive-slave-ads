Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber about the 1st of August, last, a negro man named JACOB; formerly the property of Edward Laughinghouse, Esq. Said negro is about 38 or 40 years of age, very small, and dark complected. He is so well known in Washington and its vicinity, (where there is no doubt he uses,) that I think a minute description of him unnecesary. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver said negro to me or confine him in jail so that I get him.<BR>FENNER B. SATTERTHWAITE.<BR>November 11th, 1837--69
