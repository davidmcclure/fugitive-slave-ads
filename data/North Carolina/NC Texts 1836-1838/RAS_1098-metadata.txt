Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR>  RAN AWAY , from the Subscriber, on Sunday the 26th inst., a negro man named SAMPSON, about thirty years of age, five feet eight or ten inches high, rather spare built, dark complexion, small eyes, has a rather down look and a bad countenance. His outside clothing are principally of homespun and brown satinet. He has a brother belonging to Daniel Williamson, (of this county,) and some connexions in Newbern, where he may be lurking. The above reward will be given for the delivery of him to me, or his confinement in any jail so that I get him, and all reasonable expenses paid; and should he resist in being taken, so that violence is necessary to arrest him, I will not hold any person liable for damages should the slave be killed. All persons are strictly forewarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying him off, under the penalty of the law. <BR>  ENOCH FOY. <BR> Jones County, Nov. 28th, 1837. 483kt
