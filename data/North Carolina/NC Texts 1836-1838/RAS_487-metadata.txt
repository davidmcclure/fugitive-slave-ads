Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>IS OFFERED for the apprehension and confinement of my boy HORACE in any Jail in the State so that I get him again. HORACE absconded on the 6th inst. and is most probably in or about Newbern, where he has a mother, and where his reputed father the celebrated 'Tom Lewis' makes 'Head Quarters.' He also pretends to have a wife in the immediate vicinity of Trent Bridge, and may be occasionally lurking in that neighborhood. HORACE is about 20 years of age, is of low stature, stoops when walking, his complexion a 'crow black,' visage rather thin, with small full eyes, aqualine nose, countenance rather preposseing at first sight, but upon close examination is indicative of the most cunning malignancy, and when his attention is suddenly attracted, the balls of his eyes protrude and expose a complete white circle around them. Masters of vessels and others are forewarned against carrying away, harbouring, or employing, said slave, as I will rigidly enforce the law against all such offenders. For further information apply to Mr. JOSEPH M. GRANADE, Newbern, who will pay the reward as above. <BR> EDMUND HATCH. <BR> Jones County, Feb. 8th, 1837.  441tf.
