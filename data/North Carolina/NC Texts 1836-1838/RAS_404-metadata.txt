Transcript: $50 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber two negro slaves, viz TONEY and JOHN. Toney is about 35 years of age, five feet nine or ten inches high, dark complexion, square and stout built; and had on when he left, a bright drab Peter sham overcoat. He was purchased by me of Mr. Richard Bradley of Wilmington, and calls himself Toney Montague, John is about twenty years of age, of rather lighter complexion than Toney, about five feet 10 inches high, and is quite stout built--has a full round face, and has lost two front teeth above and below, which is his most distinguishing mark. He had on when he left, a light grey woolen round Jacket and pantaloons.<BR>The above slaves left the camp of the subscriber while on his way to the Western country, eight miles above Lincolnton, on 28th of last month, and will no doubt endeavor to make their way back to Wilmington. The above reward will be given for their apprehension, so that I get them again.<BR>JAMES MOORE.<BR>Dec. 10, 1836--tf21
