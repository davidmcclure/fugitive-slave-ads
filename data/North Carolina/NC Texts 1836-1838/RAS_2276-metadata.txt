Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR>RAN away from the plantation of the subscriber, in Onslow county, on Saturday night, the 27th of January last, a NEGRO MAN, named Adam, aged about twenty five years, of very black complexion, about five feet nine or ten inches high. He has a vacancy in his front teeth, both above and below, as if a tooth had been extracted. But he says he never had a tooth where there seems to be the two missing. Said negro was raised in Sampson or Duplin county, perhaps partly in each. He says he has acquaintances in Cumberland county, and that he has at some previous time been run away, and was fed in Fayetteville, by a negro by the name of Willis, who at that time belonged to a hotel. He will no doubt be lurking about in Cumberland, Sampson, and Duplin counties. I will give the above reward for his apprehension and confinement in jail, so that I get him. I purchased Adam of Mrs. Julia A. Bunting, now of Wayne county, and formerly of Duplin.<BR>Any person apprehending said negro will please to address me at French's Mills, Onslow county, N.C.<BR>DANIEL L. RUSSELL.<BR>Onslow, February 7th, 1838.<BR>109 6w<BR>The Fayetteville Observer will insert the above six weeks, and forward the account to this office.
