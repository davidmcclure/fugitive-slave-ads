Transcript: Ranaway<BR>FROM the Subscriber, in the City of Raleigh, on the 12th inst. his<BR>Negro man HARRY<BR>aged about 35 years, black complexion, and very full face.  He has a scar on his forehead, made by a recent cut, which is very perceptible.  Also, when a child, he had his left hand cut by the Saws of a Cotton Gin, which on examination, may be perceived, tho' he has the use of them now very well.  Harry is a stout Negro, about the common height, and dresses remarkably well.<BR>I will give a reasonable reward to any person who will apprehend said Negro, and confine him in any Jail, so that I get him again.  I think he will endeavor to pass as a free man, and will aim for some of the free States.<BR>LEWIS HOLLOMAN.<BR>July 15, 1837.    37
