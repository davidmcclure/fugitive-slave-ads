Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward,<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension of RICHARD, a Negro fellow belonging to me, who ranaway from my brother, on his way to Alabama, about the 10th of the present month.  Richard is a stout, well-built fellow, about 30 or 33 years old, black skin, 5 feet, 9 or 10 inches high, will weigh, I suppose 170 or 175 pounds, has a tolerably large mouth, small, keen eyes, and very fair, white teeth.  He was purchased from some person in Raleigh, whose name I do not remember, and taken to Buncombe, 6 or 8 years ago, and was sold a year or two since, as the property of Col. Richardson, of that county.  He had, while in Raleigh, and still has, a free woman of colour for a wife, by the name of Jane Tucker.  Jane is a small Mulatto woman, 25 or 30 years old, and, as I am informed, sustained while in Raleigh, a good character.  She followed Richard to Buncombe, and then to this county, where she has resided for the last year or so.  She is now making arrangments to return to Raleigh, where I have no doubt her husband will attempt also to get.  Any information about Richard will be thankfully received by the subscriber, living near Morganton, N.C. who will compensate any person affording him assistance in trying to get this fellow.<BR>JOHN E. BUTLER.<BR>Morganton, Nov. 15, 1836
