Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on 19th of November, a negro man, named TIM, about 45 years of age, black complexion, about five feet four or five inches high, has a stoppage in his speech. He professes to be a very devout Baptist. Having purchased him in Montgomery county, not far from Stokes' Ferry, my opinion is, that he is in that neighborhood. I will give the above reward for his apprehension and delivery to me.<BR>HENRY S. GORMAN.<BR>Concord, Dec. 17, 1836--4w22
