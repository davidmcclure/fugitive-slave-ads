Transcript: $50 Reward. <BR>RAN AWAY from my residence about 14 miles from Newbern on the 1st of July last, a negro boy named POLLACK. His complexion is jet black--about 19 years old, and 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high. On first looking at any person, he looks straight, but if he continues to look any length of time he squints with one eye. He is probably lurking about J. C. Stanly's plantation on the Washington road, where his parents reside. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me, or lodge him in any Jail in this State so that I can get him. Masters of vessels are hereby forwarned against carrying him away, as it is probable he will attempt to get to a free country. It is possible that he may have a forged free paper, as his father is a free man. <BR>MARY PALMER. <BR>October 5th, 1836.
