Transcript: $50 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, near Chapel Hill, on January 27th last, a Negro Fellow, named Ames, about 22 years of age. He is about 5 feet, 9 inches in height, dark complexion, slender built, stoops a little forward in walking, speaks low, but tolerably quick when spoken to; his upper teeth on the right side are somewhat defective. When last heard of he was on the road to Wilmington, where I purchased him of John W. Hamilton, on the 1st day of November last. He took with him a small Bay Mare, with blazed face, one white foot, and hipshot in her left hip.--The above reward will be given to any person who deliver him to me or secure him in such way that I may get him again.<BR>BURRHUS CHEEK,<BR>Chapel Hill, Orange Co.,N.C.<BR>February 10th, 1837.<BR>5 t-f.
