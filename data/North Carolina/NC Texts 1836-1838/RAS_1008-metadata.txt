Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>Ranaway on Christmas eve last, negro man ALBERT, the property of Sylverter I. Jordan, minor. Albert was hired out in Hyde county last year, by me, as Guardian of said minor, to Jos.[Joseph] S. May, near Germanton. Hyde county, who gave him a permit to come to me, to be hired out for this year, but instead of doing so, has left, I presume, for the purpose of making his way to some free State--as he absconded without any provocation whatever. He will likely endeavor to pass for a free man; and in order the more successfully to practice the deception, may have succeeded in getting some unprincipaled wretch to forge for him free papers. Said boy is a very arch fellow, about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, complexion rather light but not bright--his feet very much turned out when walking, steps high, leans forward in his body, spare built, of pleasing address, but when spoken to by his superiors has rather a down cast look, and has somewhat of a suspicious appearance, full forehead, with an intelligent countenance, prominent cheek bones--believe he has a set of good teeth. He is about 24 or 5 years old. Siad[sic] boy, when he left, wore a silk beaver hat, narrow brim, somewhat worn, clothes mostly of woollen homespun of a dove colour, and an old blue cloth coat.<BR>The above reward of FIFTY DOLLARS will be given to any person who will deliver him to me at my residence on Pungo creek, near Bath Postoffice, Beaufort county, N C--or confine him in any jail in this or any other State, so that I get him.<BR>All masters of vessels, stage and rail road contractors, and all other persons are hereby forewarned from harbouring, concealing, employing, or carrying him away, under the severest penalty of the law--as I intend to rigidly enforce upon any person or persons who may be guilty; and I will liberally reward any person for such information as may convict any person who may or may have either harboured, employed, concealed, or carried him away.<BR>WM.[William] S. CORDON,<BR>Guardian to S. I JORDAN,<BR>Pungo creek, near Bath P.O.}<BR>Beaufort co , N. C. Jan. 18, 1838}<BR>6 6w
