Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS<BR>REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the plantation of the subscriber, near Leaksville, Rockingham Co., North Carolina, his negro man<BR>MOSES,<BR>Taking a horse from said plantation, which he no doubt has rode off. He is of low stature [illegible]ing five feet, five or six inches high, stout and well made, complexion dark, but not very [illegible] face broad and full, with tolerable large [illegible] and about twenty-two or three years of age. He probably has with him a bundle of clothes as none of his clothes can be found. The above negro I took out of Pittsylvania Jail Va. a few months since. He then changed his name and said he belonged to some other man, and he probably will do the same again, if taken. The horse he rode off on is of a bay colour with a scar in his forehead, near five feet, two or three inches high, his upper lip twisted a little to one side and about seven years of age.<BR>The above sum I will give to any one for taking up the negro and horse, so that I get them again--or fifteen dollars for the negro, and five dollars for the horse, if taken alone.<BR>ABNER WEBSTER.<BR>Madison, N. C. Nov. 8th, 1837.<BR>Nov 18, 1837--3m18
