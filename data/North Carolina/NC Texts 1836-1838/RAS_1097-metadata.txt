Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward <BR> WILL be given for the apprehension and delivery to me of the following runaway slaves, viz. SAMUEL, and JUDY his wife with their four children, HENRY, BURTON, NELSON and MARY,--belonging to the estate of Sacker Dubberley, deceased. Sam is a dark mulatto or yellow negro, about 36 years old, five feet eight or nine inches high, has straight black hair, dresses very well, reads and writes, and when spoken to, has a pleasing appearance. Judy is about 36 years old, and of small stature. The children are from eight months to twelves years old. <BR>  I will also give a further Reward of Ten Dollars  for the apprehension of WILLIAM DUBBERLY, a slave belonging to the above estate. William is about nineteen years old, quite white, has straight hair, and would not readily be taken for a slave: one of his arms is longer than the other when stretched out, and has a scar on one of them. Sam and Bill are no doubt together, as they are brothers; and Sam may attempt to pass as the slave of Bill: they are well known in Craven and the adjoining Counties, and in Newbern. <BR>  I will give the above reward for their apprehension and delivery to me, in New Bern, or for securing them in  jail so that I get them; or Ten Dollars for either of them. All persons are forewarned from harboruing, employing, or carrying them out of the State, under the penalty of the law. <BR>  JOHN T. LANE, Executor of S. Dubberly. <BR>  New Bern, Craven County, } March 13th, 1837.} 446ktdufo
