Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.  <BR>  RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 8th instant, his negro man JACK. Jack is about 35 or 36 years of age, five feet five or six inches high, light black complexion, and weighs about one hundred and forty pounds. He is probably lurking about the neighbourhood of Spicer Lane, Esq.[Esquire], of whom I purchased him a few years since, or at Fort Barnwell, Craven County, or in Newbern, at all of which places he is well known. The above reward will be given to any person who will apprehend the said fellow, and lodge him in jail in Newbern, or deliver him to the subscriber, near Swift Creek Bridge.  <BR>   FREDERICK CARNEY,  <BR>  24th Feb. 1837. 444vt*
