Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR>   RAN AWAY from the subscriber, about the 15th of December,1836, two negro fellows, viz., DICK and MOSES. Dick is a first rate carpenter by trade, is about 6 feet high, yellow complexion, stout, broad in the shoulders, larges cheek bones, with whiskers. Dick is an artful cunning fellow, and will attempt to pass as a free man, and perhaps obtain free papers. He has a mother in Newbern, where he will go. <BR>MOSES, a black fellow, about 40 years of age, stoops a little when walking, speaks slow, had a pleasant countenance, a fair set of teeth, by trade a cooper, has a free wife in Washington. I purchased Moses of Mr. William Franks, near Bath, in Beaufort county. <BR>The above negroes left me at Washington, N.C. A reward of Thirty Dollars of each will be paid if taken in the state, and Fifty Dollars for each if taken out of the State, and secured in jail so that I get them. <BR>All persons are warned not to employ said negroes or harbour them. All masters of vessels, and others are cautioned not to take them out of the State, at their peril. <BR>THOMAS BRAGG. Sen'r.<BR>Warrenton, N.C.,  Dec. 1836.<BR>The Editors of the Newbern Spectator, and Beacon, Norfolk, will please publish the foregoing until forbid, and forward their accounts to the office of the Washington Whig. 455tf.
