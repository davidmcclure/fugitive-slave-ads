Transcript: Ranaway<BR>FROM the subscriber, on the 10th inst. a bright mulatto girl, named HETTY, on her left cheek is a very notable scar or hole, caused by the tooth ache, about the size of a sixpence, and has lost nearly all her teeth. She is 25 years old, and about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high, she is slender and carries herself very erect. Her clothing is good, and has amongst them several good silk dresses. I will give a reward of ten dollars if taken in this county, or twenty five dollars if apprehended out of it, and delivered to me, or lodged in jail, so that I get her.<BR>JAMES H. BLAKE.<BR>Jan. 18, 1837.<BR>29tf
