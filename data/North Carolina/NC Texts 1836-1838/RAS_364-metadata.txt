Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on the 10th of January, a negro man by the name of<BR>ESSECK,<BR>About 27 years of age, light complexion, about six feet high, and has two scars on his breast. When he left the premises, he had on white yarn clothes. As he has a wife at Mr. Haywood's quarter on Tar River, it is probable he is lurking about the neighborhood. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me uninjured. I forewarn all persons from harboring or employing said negro under the penalty of the law. My residence is 18 miles from Tarborough, on Fishing Creek, and one mile above Coffield's Bridge.<BR>WILLIAM DRAUGHON.<BR>Feb. 6, 1838.
