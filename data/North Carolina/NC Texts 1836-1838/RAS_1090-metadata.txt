Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on Tuesday the 14th inst., a negro man named ALFORD, a likely looking boy, about 21 years old, five feet 9 or 10 inches high, spare built, light complexion and good looking teeth; when spoken to he has a sprightly appearance, and is at times very talkative, but will not be apt to condemn himself unless carefully observed. He had on when he left home, a blue cloth coat and slick hat, and carried with him a bombazet frock coat and may other things, and will probably appear quite respectably clad. The above reward will be given for his confinement in jail so that I get him, if he be apprehended out of this county, and Twenty-five Dollars, if taken within the county. <BR> ELIJAH CANADAY.<BR> Beaufort, Carteret County, 16th Nov. 1837.  482tf
