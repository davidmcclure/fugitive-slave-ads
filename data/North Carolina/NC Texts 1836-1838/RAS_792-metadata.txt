Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward<BR>Is offered for my negro man GEORGE, generally known by the name of George Tooley, who left my service about the 1st inst. without any provocation whatever. He is of middle stature, of yellow complexion, has large whiskers, speaks quick when spoken to, dresses well and wears a drab hat: he was raised in Currituck Hyde county, where his mother now lives. As he may endeavour to get to the north, I forewarn all masters of vessels, and others, from harbouring or taking him out of the state, under the penalty by law in such case made and provided. He is probably among the people of colour on the south side of Pamptico river, or he may be passing in Newbern as a free man. The above reward will be paid to any person who will deliver said fellow to me, or secure him in some jail so that I get him again.<BR>SAML.[Samuel] CLARK.<BR>Leachville, Beaufort Co. 15th Oct. 1836--ct[?]
