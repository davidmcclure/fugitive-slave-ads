Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>LEFT my house on Friday evening the 26th ult. about 10 o'clock P.M. (without provocation whatever,) my negro girl SUKEY.  She is about 28 years of age, of rather a light complexion, has high cheek bones, is slender in her person, and very neat in her appearance.  Had on when she went away, a striped jean frock.  Sukey was lately owned by Wm.[William] L.B. Pearce, Esq. and formerly belonged to Wm.[William] M. Herritage, dec'd.[deceased] She is at present, (from appearance,) a strict member of the Methodist Church in this place, and is no doubt known to a majority of the members.  It is believed that she is lurking about Newbern, as she has a mother living with Mrs. Ann M'Lin, a sister, the property of Judge Donnell, and several other relatives in town; or perhaps she may be skulking between this place and Kinston, or in the nieghborhood of Mr. F. M'llwain's plantation, on Neuse road, having relatives at both places.<BR>All persons are cautioned against harbouring or employing said negro woman, as I am determined to enforce the law in such case made and provided.<BR>The above reward will be paid to any person who will apprehend and deliver said negro to me, or secure her so that I get her again.<BR>JAMES AYKROYD.<BR>October 4--48tf
