Transcript: Stop the Runaways!!<BR>$120 Reward<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension of six Negro Fellows, who escaped from us yesterday morning, on the road from Fayetteville to Cheraw, S.C., viz.<BR>TOM<BR>A large, likely black fellow, about 27 years of age, a pleasant countenance, and very intelligent negro.-- He will no doubt be lurking about Fayetteville, having been owned for a considerable length of time by Gabriel Holmes, Jr.[Junior] Esq.[Esquire], of that place, and having a wife in the vicinity. <BR>CHARLES,<BR>A large, well set black fellow with large whiskers, lately owned by Archibald McKay, in the upper end of Cumberland county.  He is about 25 or 30 years of age and quite shrewd; he will no doubt return to that neighbourhood again, as he has a wife there.<BR>IVEY,<BR>A stout built fellow, light complexion, round face, with a fine set of teeth--smiles when spoken to; he was sold by Mr. Bridges of Chatham county, to Jonathan Harralson, Esq.[Esquire], of whom we purchased him.<BR>LOVELACE,<BR>A stout fellow, rather light complexion, with thick lips, about 30 years of age.  As he was purchased from Mr. B.A. Barham, of Raleigh, it is very presumable he will return to that place, having a wife there, and a general acquaintance among the blacks.  He is a most artful rascal--pretends to great sanctity, as all his theme is religion.  He is well known as a Presbyterian preacher.<BR>EPHRAIM,<BR>A small fellow, light complexion, good countenance, about 30 years of age.  He will also endeavor to get back to Raleigh, as he was sold to us by Gen. Barringer, and having a wife there.<BR>SANDY,<BR>A small black fellow, short neck and big mouth, about 22 years of age, articulates badly.  He was sold by John Brown of Cumberland, and will, in all probability, return to that neighbourhood.  We will give the above reward for the apprehension of the said Negroes, if lodged in any jail in the State, so that we get them, or $20 for each, so taken and secured.<BR>N.B. POWELL,<BR>JOHN D. WALKER.<BR>Fayetteville, October 23, 1828.--94tf.
