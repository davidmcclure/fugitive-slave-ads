Transcript: Runaway,<BR>FROM the Subscriber on the 26th October last, a Negro man by the name of TOM.  He is a small built man, about 40 years of age, light coloured, and about one fourth Indian, with large whiskers.  He has some pretensions to politeness, though really a simpleton, and a great drunkard; he took with him a short purple coloured coat, and probably pantaloons of the same colour.  I think he will lie about Fayetteville until he can meet with an opportunity of getting on board a boat in order to go to the North.  His mother is living in Fayetteville, and belongs to Mr. Jonathan Evans, and is known by the name of Sall Cochran.  Said Tom may have with him a free pass.  All owners of boats or vessels may take this as a warning not to admit him on board.  I will give a reasonable compensation to any person who will apprehend him so that I get him again.<BR>JOSEPH TANNER.<BR>Anson County, N.C. Nov. 29, 1828.    1-4w.
