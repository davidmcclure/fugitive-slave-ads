Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, about the 1st of October last, a negro man named LEONARD; about 32 years of age, about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, very dark complexion, and uncommon large eye lids. I have some reason to suspect that he has steered his course to Pasquotank county. I will give the above reward of twenty dollars to any person who will deliver him to me in Stokes county, or ten dollars to any person who will apprehend and secure him in any Jail, so that I get him again, and will pay all reasonable expenses.<BR>WILLIAM VOSS.<BR>Stokes county, Nov. 17, 1828<BR>43 4wp
