Transcript: Notice.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, residing in Wake county, seventeen miles north of Raleigh, two negro men, BURWELL and DICK. These negroes were sold in the city of Raleigh on the 20th of February by the Commissioners of Treasurer Haywood, dec.[deceased] Dick is about twenty-eight years of age, and about six feet high. Burwell about thirty-five years of age, five feet four inches high, and close built. Burwell lived at one of Treasurer Haywood's plantations near Newbern for several years, and it is possible he may go there. I will give a liberal reward to any person who will apprehend said negroes and deliver them to me, or lodge them in any jail in the State, so that I get them again.<BR>ROBERT BOYD.<BR>June 3, 1828<BR>24-4w
