Cinderilla is a likely negro, about 20 years old, tall, well made, and dark complexion. John belongs to the heirs of Danl.[Daniel] Redmond, but is hired to me for the present year. Cinderilla and her child were purchased by me in January last, at the sale of Bell & Joyner's property in Edgecombe county--said negroes are supposed to be lurking in the neighborhood between Tarborough and Teat's bridge. A reward of $25, will be given for the apprehension of the above negroes, if delivered to me or secured in any jail so that I get them again; or, ten dollars for either of the grown negroes, and five dollars for the child.<BR>ROBT.[Robert] JELKS.<BR>Halifax County, July, 1829. 48-3
