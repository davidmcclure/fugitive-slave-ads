Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from Wm.[William] Barnes, of Wayne county, a negro man named MOSES, about 35 or 40 years old, weighing about 160 lbs. large beard, with a scar on his chin, caused by a whip saw, the lower part of one ear bit off, large scars on his belly occasioned by a burn, another scar on his leg by a cut with a broad axe. The said negro went off about 6 years ago, and carried off with him his wife, Pheribe, belonging to me. The said negro Pheribe is a small yellow woman about 35 years of age; no particular marks recollected. I expect the said negroes are passing about the State as free negroes. The above reward will be given for the apprehension and delivery of said negroes to me, or lodging them in any Jail in the State so that I get them, or twenty-five dollars for either of them.<BR>EPHRAIM DANIEL,<BR>Living near Stantonsburg,}<BR>Edgecomb county.}<BR>December 17, 1828<BR>1 tf
