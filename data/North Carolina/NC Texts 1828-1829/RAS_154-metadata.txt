Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RAN OFF from the Subscriber, on the 18th of June last,<BR>Six Negroes,<BR>To wit:--Negro fellow CORY, very black complexion, spare made, long whiskers, about 28 years of age. His wife FANNY, very black complexion, low, well set negro, has been my cook for several years, and the signs may be seen on her arms from the heat of fire--this negro woman Fanny, has her daughter NANNY, eight years old 7th inst. very black, thin made, thin jaws, and very long head--and her second daughter EMILY, 28 months old, of a more yellow cast than either--Also, her son ARNOLD, born the 17th of February last. And the sixth is a very bright yellow girl named ADALINE, 21 years old, stout and well made, with a burnt place on the left side of her head, which she received by falling in the fire when an infant--this girl is in the habit of combing her black hair over this burnt place to hide the scar--she has been brought up in my house entirely--I expect she will attempt to pass as a free girl, and change her name. This girl has a variety of good clothes--but a few days before she set off, she broke into her mistress's trunk and took with her sundries of wearing apparel, she also had a black fut hat. The whole of these negroes carried off a variety of clothes, even their bed and furniture. I expect these negroes are lurking in Edgecombe county, in the neighborhood of Mr. Whitaker's old mill, near Mrs. Benton's quarter, on Fishing Creek.<BR>ELOPED from the Subscriber, on the 24th of March last, my man PETER--said negro was formerly the property of Mr. James Jones, of this county. I purchased said negro at August Court last--Peter has a wife at Dr. Vaughan's, near Mr. Nickels' store in Scotland Neck, where I expect said negro is lurking about at this time--said fellow has a dark complexion, is stout and well made, and about 35 or 40 years of age.<BR>ALSO, on the 26th of May last, ran off negro man KING, very black complexion, 6 feet 5 or 6 inches high, thin visage, eyes sunk very deep in his head, gray head and beard, about 55 years old. I forewarn all persons from harboring, carrying off, or concealing said negores under the penalty of the law. I will pay the above reward for those eight negroes, if delivered to me or secured in Jail so that I get them again, or Twenty Dollars each for the five oldest.<BR>RICKS FORT.<BR>Halifax County, near Enfield}<BR>July 23, 1828}50-3<BR>The Norfolk Herald will please insert the above three times, and forward the account to Enfield Post-Office.
