Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWY from the Subscriber in the month of June last, a bright mulatto man, about 5 feet 10 inches high, slender made, with the mark of the cut of a knife on one of his cheeks, 2 or 3 inches long.  The name of the said negro is DAVY, and sometimes calls himself Davy Littlejohn.  He was seen in the neighborhood of Raleigh within the last ten days, when a horse was stolen and it is conjectured by him, to enable him to get to the North, where it is supposed he has gone.  The above reward will be given for his apprehension and notice so that I get him again.<BR>DELIA HAYWOOD.<BR>Raleigh Nov 16 1828.    21
