Transcript: 30 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>THE above reward will be given for the apprehending negro boy SAMUEL, who left me about the 25th day of December last.  He is a very dark brown, approaching to almost a black; has a knot or scar on his forehead, is about 5 feet 6 or 8 inches high, speaks with great boldness and confidence when spoken to relative to his papers, which I have good reason to believe he has obtained.  His dress is very good, consisting of a blue frock cloth coat and pantaloons, a black suit, a dark gray sealskin cap, a furred and wool hat, boots, &c. He is about 21 years of age.  I am apprehensive that he is endeavoring to get Philadelphia or New York Captains of vessels will do well to recollect the severity of the law upon this subject.<BR>CHARLES R. YANCEY<BR>Chapel Hill, N.C. Jan.5.    36 1m<BR>The Editors of the Petersburg Intelligencer and Richmond Enquirer will please insert the above one month and forward their accounts to the subscriber and they shall be immediately discharged.
