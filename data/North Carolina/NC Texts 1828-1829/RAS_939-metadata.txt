Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 2d day of March, inst. my boy PETER. He is about 18th years old, five feet four inches high and one fourth negro blood; dark red hair, grey eyes, stout made, stooped shouldered, and has a small scar on his nose. He had on when he left me, a pair of white twilled blanket pantaloons, a blue mixed short coat, a fur hat, and worsted jacket. He will probably try to go to Mecklenburg county Virginia.<BR>Any person apprehending said boy, and committing him to jail, so that I get him again shall receive the above reward, if caught out of the State, and Ten Dollars if caught in the State. He will probably endeavour to pass himself for a free man; he can read tolerably well, and as I am told can write.<BR>WM.[William] H. ARCHIBALD.<BR>Concord, Cabarrus, county N. C.<BR>March 12, 1829.<BR>24tf.
