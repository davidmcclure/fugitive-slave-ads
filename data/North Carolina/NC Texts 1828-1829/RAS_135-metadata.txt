Transcript: $10 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber about the 16th July last, a negro woman named<BR>CREECY.<BR>She is between 25 and 27 years of age, tolerably black, about 5 feet high, has a down look, a week[sic] voice, and is round shouldered. She is in a bad state of health, being either pregnant or otherwise swelled. She was barefooted and had on white cotton clothes. As she has connexions[sic] between Halifax and Petersburg, she may have gone in that direction, but it is more probable that she is lurking in the neighborhood of Mr. James Faucett. I will pay the above reward and all reasonable expenses to any person who will deliver said negro to me 9 miles south of Halifax, or $10 to have her secured in any jail so that I get her.<BR>WM [WILLIAM] B MOORE.<BR>Aug 24, 1829<BR>29--tf
