Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>MY boy LEWIS left my plantation where I now live, on Monday, the 25th ultimo, without any cause, to my knowledge. Lewis is a dark mulatto, has something of the appearance of an Indian, is 18 or 19 years old, straight built, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, has a large mouth, and two or three of his fore teeth broken off or out; his hair is very bushy when long, but when cut lies as straight as an Indian's. He took with him a straw and a wool hat, a good many clothes, among which are a white pair of cotton jeans pantaloons; all his clothing is new. Where he will go I have but a poor guess, as he was raised in this county; but I expect he will sculk about the gold mines in this county and Mecklenburg. I will give a reward of $10 to any one who will bring him home, or $5 to secure him in jail and let me know.<BR>P. BARRINGER.<BR>Poplar Grove, Cabarrus county,}<BR>June 2, 1829.}<BR>235tf.
