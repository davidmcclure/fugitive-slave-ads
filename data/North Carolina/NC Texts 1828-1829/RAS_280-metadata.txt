Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR>I will give the above reward to any person who will apprehend and deliver to Col. Jas.[James] J Williams, of Martin county, or secure in any jail in this State so that I get him, a negro fellow by the name of BILLY, who absconded from me the 4th instant, near Pedee river, Stanback's ferry. Said negro is about forty years of age, yellow complected, and has lost one of his thumbs, I believe off of his left hand, by the bursting of a gun. He is inclined to be slim, and is about five feet ten or eleven inches high. I expect he will try to get back to Halifax county, Scotland Neck, where I lately bought him, and was on my way to the State of Louisiana, where I was about to carry him. Said negro is a keen, artful fellow, and is tolerably intelligent for a negro, and can read print, he having been in his youth a servant or waiterman to his master, and has been much in the company of white people; and unless those who meet with him, are particular in their examination, he will be very apt to deceive them. Should he return, I expect he will pass through Raleigh, where I expect he may be taken, if any person will take pains to do so.<BR>J. A. DAWSON.<BR>March 5, 1829<BR>12 5w
