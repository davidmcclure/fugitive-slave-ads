Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, on the 3d inst. a negro fellow named STEPHEN, about five feet nine or ten inches high, his complexion tolerably bright for a negro, with a remarkable scar on one of his hands (I believe left hand,) he is about 22 years of age, and has quite an agreeable countenance. As he can read and write, it is probable that he will attempt to forge such writings as are commonly considered evidence of good character and free parentage. The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver him to me at Fayetteville, or ten dollars to any one who will lodge him in any jail in this State.<BR>DILLON JORDAN, jr.<BR>July 10, 1828<BR>29-3w
