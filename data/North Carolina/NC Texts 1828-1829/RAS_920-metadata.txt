Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber some time in October last, a negro man named TOM, who sometimes calls himself Tom Indian, about 25 years old, five feet seven or eight inches high, of rather dark tawney colour, has rather a stammering in his speech. I purchased Tom of James C. Jones's estate in Franklin county, N.C. I think it quite probable that he will not confess to whom he belongs, as he once lay in Jail 12 months, and was sold to pay the prison fees without making known to whom he properly belonged. Tom says he was once owned by Gen. Wm.[William] M'Intosh, a Chief of the Creek Indians.<BR>THOS.[Thomas] MITCHELL.<BR>Caswell county, N.C.}<BR>Dec. 28th, 1828.}<BR>1-3w
