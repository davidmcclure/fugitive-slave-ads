Transcript: $50 REWARD<BR>And all reasonable expences, will be paid to any person or persons, who will apprehend and deliver to me or confine in Jail so that I get him, my negro man DAVE, who walked off on the 11th July last, he is quite a likely fellow, about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, dark complexion and has a full set of teeth, the upper ones a little projecting. He has a father living at Mr. Nathan Winslow's in Perquimans Co. by the name of Spence, (known as a fiddler) and my impressions are, that, he is either lurking in that neighbourhood, or at work in the Shingle Swamp, on the Canal. Masters of Vessels and all others are forbid employing, or carrying him off at their peril; as the law will be rigidly enforced against any who may offend.<BR>JOHN BONNER.<BR>Chowan Co. Nov. 4
