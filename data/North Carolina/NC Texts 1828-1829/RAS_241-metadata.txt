Transcript: $15 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 3d instant, his negro woman, TEMP. She is about 28 years of age, has a grim countenance, when spoken to, is five feet, five or six inches high.  I have no doubt but she is lurking about Newbern, as she has a number of relations in town.  I will give the above reward to any person that will apprehend said negro, and deliver her to me at my plantation on Trent, in Jones County, or lodge her in any jail, so that I get her again --All persons are forwarned from harboring or employing said negro, under the penalty of the law.<BR>THOMAS J. FONVIELLE.<BR>May 17.--'29'81
