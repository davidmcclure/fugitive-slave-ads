Transcript: Notice.<BR>Ranaway from the subscriber's plantation, in Anson county, a negro man by the name of DEEN, about 35 years old, and remarkably black, with one squint eye. Deen had been confined in the Jail of Richmond county as a runaway for the last 15 months; from whence he made his escape; was retaken and lodged in the Jail of Lenoir county; was brought thence by the Jailor of Richmond to this place; confined in his Jail and sold out for his prison charges; at which sale he was purchased. He took off with him his wife, a girl by the name of Dolly, about 18 years old, also remarkably black, stout, and clumsily proportioned, the property of the Rev. Elms Sinclair, of this place; also another girl about 19 years old, by the name of Jinny, of a yellow complexion, and of ordinary size, the property of Hampton Covington.
