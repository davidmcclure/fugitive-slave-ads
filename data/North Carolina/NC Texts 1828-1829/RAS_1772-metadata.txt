Transcript: Runaways.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber about the first of May last, two negro men, to wit: CAROLINA and DANIEL. Carolina was taken up and put in Stokes Jail, and says Daniel parted with him in Stokes county, and that he had a free pass, and was shot in his right arm. He is about five feet ten inches high, dark complected, and has a down look, and is thirty two years of age.
