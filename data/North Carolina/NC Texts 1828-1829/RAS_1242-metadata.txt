Transcript: Five Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber's plantation on Rockfish, about the 27th of June last, a Mulatto man named DICK, a blacksmith, about 24 or 25 years of age, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, a very plausible fellow, well known in that neighborhood.  His mother is owned by Capt.[Captain] Wm.[William] Lord, and it is probable that he may be lurking about that neighborhood.  His wife has also been runaway for some time past, and is in or about Wilmington, and it is possible Dick may have followed her.  The above reward will be paid for his apprehension and confinement in any jail so that I get him again. Should he return of his own accord, he will be forgiven.<BR>JOHN KELLY.<BR>Fayetteville, July 29, 1829.    34tf.
