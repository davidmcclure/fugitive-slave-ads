Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ranaway from the subscriber, on the 11st instant, a negro man by the name of SOLOMON, thirty years old, about five feet six or seven inches high, thick built, is remarkably strong, large arms, and from the shoulder to the end of his fingers, uncommonly long, large ankles, and his feet broadest directly under the ankle joint; he weighs about 175, his complexion little yellow, high forehead, can read tolerably well, and it is most likely took away with him several books, particularly a Testament, with his name in it, (also the words ""a present for Sunday school teaching,"") he is quite ingenious, such as Black Smith, Carpenter, Cooper and Shoemaker; took with him about two suits of clothes, one of which was white cotton warp, and filled with white wool, coarse; the other somewhat fine, white warp and mixed filling, cotton and black wool; wore a black fur hat. It is quite likely that he will try to procure a free pass, or endeavour to fall in with some person travelling to Tennessee; as he has a hankering that way. Any person taking him up and securing him in some Jail so that I get him, or bring him to me, shall receive the above reward.<BR>PHILLIPS MOORE.<BR>Mount Tirzah, Person county, N.C. 23d May 1829}<BR>22 3tp
