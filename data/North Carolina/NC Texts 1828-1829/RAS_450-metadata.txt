Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward. <BR> RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 7th inst. a likely mulatto Negro Man named CHARLES, late the property of John Cobb, dec. of Bertie. He is about 5 feet 10 inches high, stout made, and about 34 years of age. He carried off with him sundry articles of homespun clothing; and somewhere about 70 dollars in hand and paper money, his own property. He has, I understand, a free pass, wrote in a handsome hand by a widow woman of this County, who, as a compensation, received 10 dollars. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me, or secure him so that I get him again. All masters of vessels are hereby cautioned against carrying him off at their peril. <BR> DAVID GASKINS. <BR> Bertie, Dec. 21, 1809.  3w 199
