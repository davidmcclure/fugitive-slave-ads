Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 20th inst. my Negro Boy CHARLES, a bright mulatto, nearly two-thirds white, 16 or 17 years old, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, and weighs about 120 or 130 lbs.  He has a scar over one of his eyes, extending one and a half or two inches obliquely upward and forward, appearing somewhat as if cut by a sharp instrument, he may however attempt to alter its appearance.-- He has also a scar three or four inches long on one of his legs, extending in the direction of the shin bone; he has very little if any beard; his hair is dark, and was long and bushy, but it is likely he may cut it.  He wore off a fur or hair cap, a neat frock coat, originally olive but had faded, and had been patched under the right arm; his pantaloons were fine black cassimere, but considerably worn.  His hands and fingers are short and clumsy, and his little fingers are disproportionally[sic] short and curved or bent inwardly by nature from the first joint.  His nose, upon examination, will be seen a little bent to one side.  He has travelled considerably, is very smart, of genteel appearance; and can read a little.  He has lived with me several years in the shop, and may therefore pretend to knowledge of Medicine.  I understand he means to get a free pass and try to take water for some free State.  He is profane at times, impudent, fond of liquor and chewing tobacco.<BR>I will give the above reward of $20 for his being secured in any Jail in the United States, or so confined that I get him again.<BR>NICHOLAS J. DRAKE.<BR>Oakland, Halifax county, N.C.}<BR>April 21, 1829} 67    4w
