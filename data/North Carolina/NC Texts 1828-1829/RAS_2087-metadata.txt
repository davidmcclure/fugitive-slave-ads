Transcript: $40 Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 4th July last, two NEGRO BOYS<BR>Henry & JIM.<BR>Henry is about 17 years old, yellow complexion and well shaped. Jim is about 15 years old, of dark complexion and equally well formed. They are brothers, and will probably be together; their mother by the name of BECK, lives in Edenton and I have an impression, that she may procure a pass for them and send them in the county, either above or below Edenton, as she has many acquaintances and will no doubt dress them quite well.  I will give a reward of Ten Dollars for each, if taken in Edenton or in the County of Chowan. Fifteen Dollars for each if taken out of the County, and Twenty Dollars for each if taken out of the State and secured in jail so that I get them.<BR>CHARLES HOSKINS<BR>Chowan Co. Sept. 22d.  tf 38.
