Transcript: $5 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, about the 1st of March last, a negro woman named JUDY, aged about 40 years, about the common height, slim, and very black.  Always wears a handkerchief tied about her jaws, in consequence of some complaint in them.  I expect that she has gone to the neighborhood of Tarborough, where she was raised, as I believe, and from whence she was brought by a speculator named James Dancy, and sold to Jas. [James] Smith, Esq. [Esquire] of Bladen.  She was afterwards owned by Dillon Jordan, Jr. [Junior] Esq.[Esquire] of this town, from whom I purchased her.  I will give the above reward for her delivery to me, or securing her in any jail so that I get her again.<BR>JOHN McKINNON.<BR>Fayetteville, May 20.--24-tf
