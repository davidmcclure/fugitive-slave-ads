Transcript: Stop the Thief.<BR>RAN AWAY from Capp's Gold Mine, Mecklenburg county, N.C. on Saturday, the 18th day of August, a negro man named<BR>DENNIS,<BR>About 20 years of age, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, dark complexion, with a scar on one of his cheeks as well as recollected, his left. He took with him a large grey mare, 16 or 17 hands high, with a long switch tail. He has been traced from Charlotte to Torrence's X[cross] Roads, on the Statesville road, thence through Salisbury to Greensborough, passing himself by different names and on different business. It is expected he will make for the neighborhood in which he was raised, which is not exactly known, but supposed to be near Tarborough. Any person securing him in jail, and taking care of the beast so we may get them again, shall be reasonably rewarded, by giving notice to the Subscribers, and all reasonable expences[sic] paid.<BR>NATHANIEL HOBBS.<BR>JOHN MAYHEW.<BR>Mount Mourne, Iredell Co.
