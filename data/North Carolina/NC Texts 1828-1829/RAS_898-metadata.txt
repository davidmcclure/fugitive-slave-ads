Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>I WILL give the above reward to any person who will apprehend and secure in the jails of Orange or Person county, in the State of North Carolina, my negro man<BR>SAWNEY<BR>who ran away from my plantation in the aforesaid county of Person, about the 10th of September last.  He was raised by Major Pleasant Henderson, of Chapel Hill, at whose sale I purchased him about the 18th of July last, and I have no doubt but that he is now lurking in that neighborhood.  He is neither of the darkest African black, nor is he yellow, but rather between the two colours, rather upwards of twenty years old, straight limbed, spare made, about five feet nine or ten inches high, with a high forehead, large nose, thick lips, speaks quick when spoken to, and is quite a sensible negro.<BR>Thomas M'Gehee<BR>October 21  52--3w
