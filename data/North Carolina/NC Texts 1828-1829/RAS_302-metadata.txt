Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, some time in the winter of 1827-8, a Negro man named JERRY RANDALL, well known in the neighbourhood of Newbern. He is about 35 years of age, nears six feet in height, complexion quite dark, and has a large scar on one of his shoulders. It is believed that he is lurking about either in Newbern, or the neighbourhood of Slocumb's Creek, where he has relatives. The above reward will be paid to any person who will apprehend said negro, and deliver him to me, or secure him in any jail, so that I get him.<BR>JAMES T. DAVIS.<BR>Lenoir County, Aug. 1, 1829 --pt 52.
