Transcript: $100 Reward<BR>WILL be paid for the apprehension of negro man<BR>Hughes<BR>(late the property of Mr. William Coffield dec'd) if taken without the State, or Fifty Dollars with all reasonable expences if within, and delivered to me or confined in jail so that I get him. He ranaway on or about the 23rd ult. without the slightest provocation whatever. Said fellow is about 22 or 23 years of age, dark complexion, about 6 feet high, tolerably slim built, & has a scar on one side of his head, which is entirely bald, occasioned by a burn when quite young; he may however combe his hair in such a manner as to prevent its being observed, and probably will, as it is quite conspicuous when his hat is off. When spoken to he has a down look, but speaks loud and quick. It is probable he is in the neighborhood of Elizabeth City, where he once remained for 5 months or 6 months in a similar case. Masters of vessles and all others are forbid harbouring, or carrying him off at their peril.<BR>JAMES COFFIELD.<BR>Chowan Co. June 2d.
