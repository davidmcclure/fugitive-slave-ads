Transcript: $75 Reward<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, in Chatham county, North Carolina, near Prince's Bridge, two negro men, WILLIS & PHILIP. Willis left me some time in February, 1827. He is about 36 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, thin visaged, dark complected, and has rather a down look when spoken to, his fore teeth has a considerable jut over the under ones. He has been living in Milton, on Dan River, and Guilford county, until a few weeks past, passing by the name of Isaac Evens, with a free pass, being pursued at the latter place. I have not heard of him since, but expect that he has returned to the giver of his former pass, to change his name with another, and has taken Philip along with him, and likely has procured him a free pass also. Philip is brother to Willis, and left home on the 25th of December last. His complexion is nearly the same as that of his brother, Willis. He is something lower, and about 11 years younger, and bends forward when walking. They may aim for the west or south west, as Philip's wife has lately been carried there. The above reward will be given for the delivery of said negroes, viz. fifty dollars for Willis, twenty five for Philip, or if secured by any person in any jail within the United States, so that I get them again, I will give forty dollars for Willis and twenty for Philip, or either of them, as above stated.<BR>THOMAS BELL, Sen.<BR>January 23, 1829.<BR>5 6w
