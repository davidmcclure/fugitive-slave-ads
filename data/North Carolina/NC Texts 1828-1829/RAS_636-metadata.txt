Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, living on Little River, in Johnston county, (near the dividing line between that county and Wake) on the 18th inst. his Negro Man EMSLEY.  Said negro undertands the distilling of Whiskey well, also the drinking of it-- is 50 years of age, about 5 feet 10 inches high, light complexioned, with a thin skin, and has one eye out, though it may not be discerned at the first glance.  This description, it is presumed, will lead to his detection.  As some efforts have been made to release this negro from slavery, on the grounds his being free-born, though without success, he will no doubt attempt to pass himself off as a free man.<BR>The above reward will be given for his delivery to me, or for his confinement in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>BRYAN RICHARDSON.<BR>Johnston county, May 30.
