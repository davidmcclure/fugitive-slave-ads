Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>ON Saturday night, the 4th inst. my negro boy MOSES, left my premises without my knowledge, & without any cause whatever, on my part. I bought Moses at Sheriff's sale, at the last Mecklenburg county court; he was sold as the property of Joab Alexander, Esq. deceased, at which place I believe he was born, or in its vicinity. I am informed he has a wife at a Mr. William Wallis's, where I expect he is sculking about. Moses is about 30 years old, five feet 7 or 8 inches high, stout made, down look, of rather a light complexion, (though not a mulatto.) I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me, or five dollars to any one that will have him confined in the Jail in Charlotte, Mecklenburg county.<BR>P. BARRINGER.<BR>Poplar Grove, Cabarrus county, N.C.<BR>April 10, 1829.--39tf.
