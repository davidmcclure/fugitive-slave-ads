Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber on the 10th instant, two negro men, PETER and MARK. Peter, generally called Peter Wolf, was purchased at the sale of the property of the late Treasurer, in Raleigh, and is rather above the middle size, of a yellow complexion, about five feet ten inches high, and limps a little in his gait. The other fellow, Mark, was purchased about the same time, from the estate of Stephen Haywood, dec'd[deceased]. He is quite black, of rather a pleasing countenance, and about 5 feet 4 inches in height. Both these fellows, it is believed, are lurking about the city of Raleigh. The above reward will be given for their apprehension and delivery to the subscriber, and all reasonable expenses paid, or ten dollars for either of them, or a liberal reward will be given for their confinement in any jail so that I get them again.<BR>E. H. WHITFIELD.<BR>Wayne county, N.C. Dec. 18, 1828.<BR>1 tf
