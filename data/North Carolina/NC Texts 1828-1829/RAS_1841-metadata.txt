Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward. <BR> ABSCONDED from the subscriber, in the town of Salisbury, on the 21st of the present month, May, a negro fellow named Scipio; he is about 21 years old, between 5 feet 7 and 10 inches high: Scipio is a mulatto man, very likely: he carried off with him very few clothes: a pair of blue cassimere pantaloons, and a blue cassimere or black silk waistcoat, and a whitish coloured woollen round-about jacket, and probably one other shirt and waistcoat besides the one he wore off, and old white fur hat. Scipio was raised in the county of Mecklenburg, Virginia, by Mr. Samuel L. Locket, and I expect he is aiming to get back there, or has obtained a free pass for some person and is trying to pass as a free man. The above reward will be given to any person who will confine him in jail, or deliver him to Mr. Hardie, or either of the Mr. Gileses, in the town of Salisbury; who are authorized to act as agents for me. <BR> WILLIAM HICKS.<BR>May 23, 1828. 3t18
