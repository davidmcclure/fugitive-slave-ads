Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, at Pleasant Grove, Johnston county, some time past, two negro men, VIRGIL and SOLOMON. Virgil is of dark complexion, spare built, about six feet high, thirty-five years of age, speaks slow, and when spoken to has a down look, and seems much agitated if taken on surprise. No particular marks recollected. Solomon is inclined to be of a copper colour, about five feet eight or ten inches high, about fifty years of age, speaks slow, is intelligent and plausible, and professes to be a christian; his teeth are much decayed before, has a large mouth, his feet and hands have the appearance of having been burned; his thumbs, in using his hands, bend very far, the nails on his hands and feet appear to be affected with a tetter. He may be lurking in or about Newbern, or at the Egypt Plantation of John Washington, near Fort Barnwell, in Craven county, as he has a wife at that plantation, belonging to Mr. Washington. I will give the above reward to any person who may apprehend and lodge them in Jail, so that I get them again, or ten dollars for either of them.<BR>JOHN SANDERS.<BR>Sept, 27, 1828.<BR>40-tf<BR>The editors of the Newbern Sentinel will insert the above until forbid, and forward their account to the Postmaster at Smithfield.
