Transcript: Notice well.--$20 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 10th of February 1830, a white mulatto slave named CULLEN, or CULLEN MEDLEN, as he calls himself.  He is about 23 years old, 6 feet high, well made, weighs about 165; has a red neck, hands, and mouth, his hair is a little light and kinky, grey eyes, thick feet, flat like a negro's, a small cut by an axe on the inside of his great toe at the first joint on the right foot.  Has a white hat, mixt coat, white streaked pantaloons.  It is probable that he will alter his name, and attempt to pass among the lower class of white people as a free man.  I think that he is at Wilmington, Fayetteville, or Newbern.<BR>I will give the above reward for his delivery to me near Springhill, in Lenoir county, free of any other expense, or to have him secured in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>WILLIAM ROUSE.<BR>February 20, 1830--64-8t
