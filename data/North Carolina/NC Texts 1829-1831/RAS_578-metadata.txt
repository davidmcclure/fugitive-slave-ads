Transcript: Twenty-five dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, in the latter part of February last, my negro man SIMON. He is about twenty-five years old, five feet seven or eight inches high, white teeth, and of a common black colour; he generally dresses genteely for a negro, and professes to be a Baptist. He has been lurking about in Hertford county for several months past in the neighborhood of Winton, and I understand has procured a free pass from a white man, and has quit that neighborhood. I hereby forewarn all masters of vessels and others from harboring said negro or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law. Simon is supposed to be passing at this time for a sawyer. I will give the above reward for his delivery to me, or confinement in jail so that I get him again.<BR>MOSES SMITH<BR>Roseneath, Halifax county,}<BR>N C. Oct. 4, 1830.}<BR>42 tf
