Transcript: $75 REWARD. <BR>I will give the above reward for the securing in Newbern or Trenton Jails, so that I get them within 40 days from this time, or for their delivery to me, my three negroes, viz: ISAAC, CALVIN, and JUDA; or I will give the $25 for either of them, if delivered as above. Juda has a husband belonging to John H. Becton; she ran away in May last, and, as I have understood, has since had a child. Isaac and Calvin  went off about the first of October last. They are all lurking about Jones county, where they were raised and have many connexions[sic]. <BR>THOS.[THOMAS] SPIGHT.<BR>Craven County, Jun. 8, 1830.
