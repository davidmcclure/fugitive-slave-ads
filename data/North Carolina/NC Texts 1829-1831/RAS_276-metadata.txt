Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR> RAN away from the subscriber living in Mecklenburg County, about seventeen miles south of Charlotte, a likely black boy whose name is HECTOR, stout well built and finely proportioned for a slave. He is about 25 years of age, and about six feet in height. He carried with him when he left my plantation a suit of mixed home-made, a pair  of corded pantaloons, and other cloathing which I am not able to describe. He left my plantation with other negroes and I have every reason to believe that they have taken the route thro' or near Salisbury for some of the non-slave holding States. I will give Ten Dollars if taken in the County of Mecklenburg--if out of the County or State Twenty Five Dollars, but in both cases to be secured so that I get him again. <BR> JOHN MATHEWS.<BR> Mecklenburg County, April 27th, 1831. <BR> Mecklenburg County, April 27th, 1831. <BR> The Roanoke Advocate N.C. and Knoxville Register Ten., will insert the above three times and forward their accounts for payment to this office.
