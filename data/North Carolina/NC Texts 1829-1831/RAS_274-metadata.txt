Transcript: $25 REWARD. <BR>RANAWAY in Jan. last, a Negro Man named <BR>TOM WHITFIELD, <BR>well known in and about Newbern as a House Painter. He formerly belonged to Mr. Warry Kilpatrick, of whom I bought him. He is about 40 years of age, of dark complexion, stout and well made, 5 feet, 7 or 8 inches high, and has connexions[sic] at Brice's Creek, where, or about Mr. Isaac Taylor's plantation or in Newbern, he is probably lurking.  The above reward will be paid for his apprehension and safe confinement in Jail; And if in the act of taking him, he should resist and be killed, I will not hold the person so killing, responsible for his value. <BR>HENRY B. MITCHELL> <BR>Newbern, October 17, 1829.
