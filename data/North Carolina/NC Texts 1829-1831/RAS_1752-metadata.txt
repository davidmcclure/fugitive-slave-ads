Transcript: Runaway<BR> On the 10th of September last, from my plantation in Jones county, two negroes, one named WASHINGTON, about 27 years of age, a very bright mulatto, on one of his hands there is a score occasioned by a gin; he will change his name and endeavor to pass for a free man. The other named JOHN, a common mulatto, about 30 years of age, very intelligent; he will probably pass as the servant of Washington, and change his name. A reward of 25 Dollars will be given for the delivery of either in any jail, so that I can get them. <BR> JAMES LAMAR. <BR> October 16th. <BR>The Georgian, Savannah; the Telescope, Columbia, S.C.; and Richmond Enquirer, are requested to publish the above weekly until forbid, and then forward their accounts to <BR> J.LAMAR.
