Transcript: $75 REWARD<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 30th of December last, a Negro Fellow named JIM.  He is rather black, inclining to yellow, of middle size, about 34 years of age, and two of his foreteeth out.  He is somewhat inclined to morality, and wishes to pass for a kind of sanctified fellow; he is not very talkative, and has a mild expression of countenance.  He rode away a bay Mare, about 14 1/2 hands high, and five years old next Spring.  The fellow was tolerably well dressed in cloth, with a black fur hat, plaid cloak, and saddle-bags.  It is supposed he has a forged Pass, as he had been trying to obtain one.<BR>The above reward will be paid for the apprehension and delivery of the Negro and Mare to the subscriber, 15 miles south of Charlotte, N.C. and all reasonable expenses paid; or Fifty Dollars to any person who will apprehend and lodge the Negro in any jail, so that the owner may obtain him again.<BR>A letter directed to Providence Post Office, Mecklenburg county, N.C. will be attended to.<BR>WILLIAM MATTHEWS.<BR>Jan. 4, 1831.
