Transcript: $10 REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, living on Smith-Dividing Creek, in the county of Beaufort, a few days since, a mulatto boy named BEN--about sixteen years old, rather small for his age--has a scar on his forehead something in the shape of the letter V, and the great toe of one of his feet, believed to be the right one, partially cut off.<BR>He was in Newbern last week, and is endeavoring to get to New York. He left town for the Bar, employed on board the lighter Julia, commanded by David Wallace, and will probably return. All persons, and especially masters of vessels are cautioned against harboring or carrying him away. The above reward and all reasonable expences, will be paid for delivering him to me, or lodging him in jail and giving information to Mr. Richard Grist, in Newbern.<BR>ROWLAND MAYO.<BR> 16th June, 1831.
