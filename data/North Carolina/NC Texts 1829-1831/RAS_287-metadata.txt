Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RAN away from my plantation, in Rowan county, N.C. on the 10th instant, a bright mulatto boy, named Alfred, about twenty five years of age, five feet eight or nine inches high, round shouldered, tolerably well built, straight fine light hair, speaks slow when spoken to.  His cloathing is not recollected.  I expect he will alter his name and try to pass for a free white person, in order to get to some of the non-slaveholding States.  Any person who will deliver said boy to me, or confine him in jail so that I get him again shall have the above reward.<BR>ALEXANDER SMOOT.<BR>Sept. 12, 1831.    89tf.<BR>The Editor of the Knoxville Register is requested to publish the above six weeks and forward his account to this office for payment.
