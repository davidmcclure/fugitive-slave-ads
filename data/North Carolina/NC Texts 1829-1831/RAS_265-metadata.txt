Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the Subscriber, living in Edgecomb County, N. Carolina, on the 12th day of August last, his negro man Jack; Said negro is about forty years of age, of a dark complexion, stout made, and rather over the common height: when in good health, he weighs from 175 to 180 lbs. His right leg has been broken a little below the knee, causing him to limp very bad when walking; on his left leg is a sore of several years' continuance; and on the back of one of his hands is a scar, occasioned by a knife.  His face of common features, with a broad mouth, which, when laughing, he extends to an unusal degree. He may have obtained free papers from some malicious person, and probably will attempt to pass for a free man. He has been employed, at interveals, for a number of years, as a boatman on Contentea[Contentnea] Creek and Neuse River, between Stantonsburg and Newbern; and is well known in the latter place by the name of Capt. Jack.  I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver said negro to me, or confine him in any Jail within the limits of this State, so that I get him again.<BR>JAMES SIMMS.<BR>Edgecomb County, N. Carolina, seven miles west of Stantonsburg.<BR>December 10th, 1830.    vt*
