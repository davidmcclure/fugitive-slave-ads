Transcript: $50 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 20th of July last, a Negro man named ISAAC. (though it is probable that he will alter his name, and perhaps attempt by forged papers, to pass for a freeman.) He is between 22 and 25 years of age, about six feet high, well proportioned, has very hollow feet, and a brazen look. He has been lurking about Newbern for some time past, and will no doubt endeavour to get on board of some vessel, in order to reach the Northern States. Masters of vessles and others are cautioned against harbouring or employing him, as the law in such case made and provided will be most rigidly enforced. The above Reward will be given for the apprehension of said fellow if he be taken on board of any vessel outward bound; or TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS, if taken out land.<BR>JOHN TILLMAN<BR>Lenoir County, near Kinston, N.C. Oct. 14, 1829.   mt*
