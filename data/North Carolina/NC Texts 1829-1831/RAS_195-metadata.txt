Transcript: $15 REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, in August, 1829, negro man ARTHUR, about 42 years of age, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, dark complexion, thick lips, stammers, and has a cancer on the bottom of his right foot. Arthur is a very good shoe maker, and quite probable may follow that trade. From the information received, I have reasons to suppose that he is lurking about in the lower part of this county, or in Edgecomb, near Tarborough. Any person apprehending and delivering said negro to the subscriber, living 4 miles west of the town of Halifax, or secure him in any jail, so that I get him, shall receive the above reward.<BR>JOHN PURNELL.<BR>September 7, 1831.<BR>23--tf
