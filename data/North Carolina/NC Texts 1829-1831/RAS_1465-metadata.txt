Transcript: 100 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 27th Ocotber last, a Negro man named TOM, or THOMAS JONES, as he calls himself. Tom is about 26 or 28 years old, six feet and half an inch high, rather slender made, of dark complexion, has a scar just under the left eye, about one inch in length,  and a large scar on one of his knees, occasioned by the bite of a dog; one or two of his toes have been slightly frostbitten, the nails of which are partly covered by the flesh. He wore, when he went away, a white hat, blue cloth coat, with the skirts cut off, forming a jacket, black cloth pantaloons, and a red plaid cloak. --When spoken to suddenly, he is apt to stammer a little and look downward.<BR>As he can read and write pretty well, he will probably change his name, have forged free papers, and endeavor to pass as a free man and get on to New York, where he has a mother. <BR>I will give the above reward for his delivery to me in Newbern, free of any other expences, or fifty dollars to have him secured in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>GEO.[GEORGE] A. Hall.<BR>Newbern, 20th, Nov. 1829.<BR>The editor of Norfolk Herald will please insert the above six times, and forward his account to the office of the North Carolina Sentinel for settlement.
