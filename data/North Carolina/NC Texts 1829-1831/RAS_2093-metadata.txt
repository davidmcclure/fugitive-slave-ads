Transcript: $70 Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the nights of the 4th and 6th instant, two negro men, (slaves) ISAAC and TOM.<BR>Isaac is about five feet 10 or 11 inches high, erect in stature, about 20 years of age, young look, likely, slim built, speaks quick, little lighter color, than a negro, commonly called Isaac Tredwell. He has travelled much, and driven a carriage, is therefore generally known on the main post roads. He has been almost constantly travelling for 12 months past, and may have forged free papers, as I believe he has been designing some to get away.<BR>Tom Hassell is about 20 or 21 years old, very likely, about 5 1/2 feet high, eyes redish, speaks quick and loud, has a scar over one of his eyes, I think his right one, a shade lighter in his color than usual, stout built.<BR>I will give Fifty Dollars for Isaac if taken out of the state and delivered to me, or so that I get him, or Forty Dollars for the same if taken within the state. I will give Twenty Dollars to any one who will deliver Tom Hassell to me. <BR>JONA.[Jonathan] HAUGHTON.<BR>The editor of the Norfolk Herald will please insert this three times in his paper, and forward the account to this office.<BR>May 11th, 1831.
