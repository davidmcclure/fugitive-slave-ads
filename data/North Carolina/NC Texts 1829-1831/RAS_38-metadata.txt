Transcript: $10 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 5th of June last, a Negro man named MOSES, about 35 years of age, 5 feet, 9 or 10 inches high, stout made, and very black. He is probably lurking about Fort Barnwell, Core Creek, and Newbern. He carried with him a good supply of clothing, and will probably be well dressed. All persons are forewarned from haboring, employing, or carrying him away under the penalty of the law. The above reward and all reasonable expences will be paid to any person who will apprehend and deliver him to me, or secure him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>WILLIAM McKINNEY.<BR>Craven Co. Aug. 7th, 1830.  kt*
