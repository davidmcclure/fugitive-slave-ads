Transcript: Forty Dollars Reward. <BR> RANAWAY from the subscriber living in Randolph county on Deep river, a yellow man about twenty two years of age; his complexion is of a bright colour with long straight fine, coal black hair, has somewhat the appearance of an Indian. He has a cut across his left foot near his toes. <BR> He left my plantation about the 5th inst. supposed to be in company with another negro and a white man. I have been informed that he had made application for a pass. He will probably make towards some of the free States. In that event he will pass thru'[through] the Western part of Virginia. I will give $40 reward, if taken without the State--if taken within for the state twenty Dollars, and ten Dollars if apprehended in any own county. In any event he must be secured so that I can get him again. <BR> DANL.[DANIEL] COLTRAINE.<BR> Randolph co'y. [county] Aug 18, 1830. 3t35
