Transcript: Five Dollars Reward. <BR> RANAWAY from the subscriber's plantation in Rowan county, six miles South of Salisbury, on the 13th October, a negro woman named JUDE, aged about thirty five years.

Any person apprehending said negro, and lodging her in jail so that I get her again or delivering her at my residence in Cabarrus county shall receive the above reward. <BR> JONATHAN HARTSELL.<BR> Cabarrus co'ty, October 25, 1830.  45tf
