Transcript: $25 Reward. <BR> RAN away from the subscriber in Mecklenburg County, about fifteen miles south of Charlotte, a yellow boy with thick lips and a down countenance until spoken to. He has one lap tooth in his upper jaw and is about twenty years of age. He goes by the name of SCOTT. His cloathing is not recollected. He left my plantation, it is believed, with Mr. Jno.[John] Mathews' negro and one other belonging to Mr. Potts who, it is thought, decoyed the others off. I am inclined to the opinion that they have all taken the route by or near Salisbury for some of the Northern States. I will give Ten Dollars for apprehension, if taken in the County of Mecklenburg--if out of the County of State Twenty Five Dollars-in either case to be secured so that I get him again.   3t78<BR> JAMES G. PORTER.<BR> Mecklenburg County, April 27, 1831. <BR> The Roanoke Advocate N.C. and Register Ten., will insert the above three times and forward their accounts for payment to their office.
