Transcript: STOP THE RUNAWAY.<BR>IN December last, I purchased in Raleigh, of Mr. John Morrison and Mrs. Pearson, of Moore county, a negro man by the name of SAMUEL.  On the 8th of March, said negro ran away from my plantation, near Brown's Store, in Caswell county.  Samuel is 22 years of age, about 5 feet 10 inches high, very dark complexion, of thin visage, high cheek bones, and answers very slowly when spoken to.  I understand he was raised in Moore county, by a Mr. Lewis and was sold to Mr. Pearson, who since died at Moore Court House.  He has been seen since he left me, at the house of his wife, who is the property of Mr. Pearson, the lady of whom mention is above made.  He is no doubt still lurking about there.<BR>I will give $20 reward to any person who will deliver Samuel to me, at my residence in Rockingham county; or I will give $15 for his apprehension and confinement and any Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>WILLIAM BETHELL.<BR>Rockingham county, June 6.    84 3w
