Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 25th day of April last, a negro man named<BR>PETE,<BR>a good deal above the ordinary height, and very stout; of dark complexion and aged 35 years, though apparently much younger; the only indications of age being a few scattering grey hairs. As Pete belonged to the estate of the late Wm.[William] P. Hall, he will doubtlessly be found some where in the neighborhood of Norfleet's Ferry [Berite County]. I will give the above reward for him, if delivered to me in Raleigh, or confined in any jail.<BR>A. M. BOYLAN.<BR>May 20, 1830.<BR>13--eow3t
