Transcript: Eighty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber a year past, negro man ARTHUR, aged thirty-seven years, black complexion, almost five feet ten inches high. I recollect no particular mark, as I had not long known him. His form is stout and thick built; has a few grey hairs on his head. He is by profession a carpenter, and has been working at that trade for several years past in Raleigh, and was working there at the time he went off. He is frequently seen lurking about Raleigh and its vicinity. He has a wife in that place, where he no doubt stays the greater part of his time. From the length of time he as been gone, he may try and pass as a free man. I forewarn all persons from harboring or employing said slave, under the penalty of the law. I purchased him of Dixie C. Fenner, of Halifax, in whose family he was raised. I will give the above reward of Eighty Dollars to any person who will deliver him to the Jailor of Halifax, on or before the 15th November next or Fifty Dollars if delivered to him any time thereafter.<BR>As I have no doubt but he relies upon being sold, I wish to be distinctly understood that he cannot be bought as any price, so long as he is a runaway.<BR>B. C. EATON.<BR>Halifax, Oct. 16, 1830<BR>43 2w
