Transcript: Ran Away<BR>From the subscriber, on the 15th instant, his man DAVID, who was purchased at Mr Blake Baker's sale. He is a small man, about 35 years old, and slovenly in his dress--is a carpenter by trade. His clothing is not recollected. His wife was taken off to the Alabama about 6 weeks since by her master, Capt. Thomas Turner, from Halifax county. It is believed that David will attempt to follow his wife.
