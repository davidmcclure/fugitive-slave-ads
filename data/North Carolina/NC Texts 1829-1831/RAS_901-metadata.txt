Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from my overseer  about the first of April last, MANUEL, a slave, which I purchased at the  sale of the late Reuben Sanders, Esq. He is about 21 years old, yellow  complected, though not a mulatto, is very likely, and will weigh about  175 or 180 lbs. It is likely he is lurking about in Johnston county or  in and about Raleigh. The above reward will be given for his delivery to  me, or secured in jail that I may get him.<BR>N.  WHITFIELD.<BR>Lenoir county, April 30, 1831<BR>21 3t
