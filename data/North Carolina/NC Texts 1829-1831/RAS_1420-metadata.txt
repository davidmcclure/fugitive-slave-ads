Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, some time in June last, a mullatto[sic] girl, named Maria, about nineteen or twenty years of age five feet high, thick set round form, has rather a down look, and speaks quick when spoken to. She is probably lurking about Stone's Bay, near Col. E. Williams's plantation in Onslow, where she has relations; or she may have gone to Wilmington.--The above reward will be given to any person, who who will apprehend and deliver said girl to me, or confine her in jail, so that I can get her again, if taken out of the County; or five dollars, if taken in the County.      P. MARSHELL.<BR>Onslow County N. C. July 12th--21--1m.
