Transcript: Runaway <BR> On the 25th of June last, from my plantation in the lower part of Iredell, at Turbyfills ferry, on the Catawba river, my negro man named Abram, near forty years of age, a mulatto about 5 feet 8 or ten inches high, round shouldered and a scar on the left side of his neck occasioned by cutting with a Lancet for the scrofula.  It is thought he has obtained a free pass from some person. I would be glad, if it be so, that person apprehending the negro, would keep the pass; so that I can see it. For the apprehension of said negro, so that I get him, I will give a reward of five dollars if taken up in this neighbourhood, ten dollars if thirty miles or more distant from my house. <BR>2t79    JOHN MAHEW. <BR> June 29th. 1831.
