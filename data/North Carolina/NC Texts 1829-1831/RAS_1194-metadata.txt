Transcript: Notice.<BR>TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 14th inst. negro man DASON, about 28 years of age, about 5 feet 10 inches high, dark complexion, with rather a down look.

Any person apprehending said negro and delivering him to me, or securing him in any jail so that I get him again, shall be entitled to the above reward of Ten Dollars. I also forwarn all persons from harboring said negro under the penalty of the law.<BR>9<BR>JOHN EDMONDSON.<BR>Edgecombe county, 15th Oct. 1829.
