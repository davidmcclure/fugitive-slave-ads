Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on the 27th of August last, a Negro Man named BALAAM, about 45 years of age, six feet high, very black, has a scar on his forehead, is remarkably bow-legged, and has a very good countenance. He may probably have taken his course for the Forked Deer, in Tennessee, as his wife was carried there by Mr. Frederick Holt last winter. A reward of five dollars will be given for his confinement in any jail in this State, or ten dollars if confined in any jail out of the State, so that I can get him again.<BR>ANN NORTHINGTON.<BR>Cumberland County, N.C, Sept. 6.     44-1tp.
