Transcript: Twenty five Dollars<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension and confinement of DERRY, who ran away from the subscriber about 5 months ago. Derry, generally known by the Carpenter, is a brown mulatto, of a small stature and thin visage, about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high. He speaks quick and rather boastingly, and, I believe, has lost some of his foreteeth. He has been several times seen, by persons of colour, near Nixonton, in Pasquotank County, in the neighbourhood of which place he has relations, by whom he is probably harboured and kept out. The above reward will be given for his apprehension and confinement, or twenty Dollars, and reasonable charges, for his delivery to<BR>JAS.[James] NORCOM.<BR>Edenton, Sept. 2 5w 36.
