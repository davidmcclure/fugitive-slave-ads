Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscribor, on the morning of the 27th ult. his<BR>Negro Man Jack,<BR>beetween[sic] 30 and 35 years of age, tall and rather slim built, very black complexion, eyes look red, and his teeth defective before.  It is supposed he is lurking about Newbern, or the plantation of William Gaston Esq. (on Brices Creek) of whom I bought him.<BR>I will give a reward of Fifty Dollars to any person that will deliver said Negro to me, or secure him in Jail so that I get him again.<BR>As said negro went off without any knowledge on my part of his dissatisfaction, I suppose he must have been enticed away by his wife, who belongs to one of my neighbours, and has been runaway about three months, and who, it seems, he had concealed, and when found out, took himself off. If Jack wishes to be sold, and will procure any person to buy him, he shall be gratified.<BR>Nicholson Washington.<BR>Wayne County, Nov. 3, 1818.-3w*
