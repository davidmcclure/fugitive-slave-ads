Transcript: NOTICE<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber this day, a Negro man by the name of JOHNSTON; he is a [illegible] runaway, this being the third time that he has attempted to make his escape.  I have no reason to doubt but that he has procured the Pass of one Jeremiah Mayho; which pass was granted to said Mayho by the General Assembly of North-Carolina, with some other papers or reccomendation (perhaps with the signature of the most respectable gentlemen of the county, as ne[?] by some mean[s] procured such the past fal[fall], and made off to Newbern, and nao[?] well nigh made his escape).  Johnston is about 5 feet nine inches high, stout made, about 25 years of age, of a very bright yellow complexion, branded on the right cheek with the letter R, scacely to be discriminated: the under part of his left ear bit off by fighting.  Johnston will no doubt endeavor to pass for a free man.  This is to forewarn all masters of vessels from engaging or employing him, and also every other person from harboring him in any Jail so that I get him again, or Fifty Dollars if delivered to me at my house in Granville, N.C.<BR>GEORGE L. MOORE.<BR>December 27    55 2w<BR>N.B. Johnston is an excellent Blacksmith.
