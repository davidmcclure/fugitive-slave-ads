Transcript: Stop the Runaway. <BR>Deserted from the service of Lodowick Fluellin, in this county, on the 25th December last, a Negro Man named <BR>CUPID, <BR>who belongs to Nicholas Arrington, orphan of Gen. Wm.[William] Arrington. CUPID is about 40 years old, near 6 feet high, well made, a common yellow, the middle fore finger of one of his hands is off at the first joint: his countenance is unpleasant and would quick prove his guilt with a few questions. Cupid is a Shoe-maker by trade. He took from the shop of Mr Fluellin, shoes leather and tools suitable for his trade.--Cupid was persuaded off by a free woman whom he had taken up with as a wife by the name of ELIZA TURNER. She is a smart yellow wench, perhaps 25 or 30 years old, sly timid countenace. She tells that she has made Newbern, Washington, and Tarborough her places of her residence, I am of opinion they are at or in the neighborhood of one of those places, Cupid's intention will be & perhaps he is at this time passing for a free man, & may have alterted his Name and procured a Pass to that effect from some villain. <BR>I will give Thirty Dollars reward to any person who will deliver to me the said Cupid and Eliza, or Ten Dollars to confine Cupid in Jail so that I him again. <BR>Any information relative to them will be forwarded to me. <BR>LAWRENCE BATTLE, Guardian. <BR>Nash County, Swift Creek, April 14. 3t <BR>N.B. All persons, particulary masters of vessels, are cautioned against employing or harboring, coveying or suffering to be conveyed on board their vessel, the above described slave Cupid, to or from any port, harbor, or any place in the world. <BR>L. B.
