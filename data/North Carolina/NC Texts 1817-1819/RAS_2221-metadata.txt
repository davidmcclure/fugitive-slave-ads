He took with him a dark mix'd coat and pantaloons, one cambric shirt, one cotton and one thread do. one calico vest and one of sawnsdown with bullet buttons, one fur and one wool hat, some shoemaker' tools, one pair of shoes and leathers for another pair. He will probably attempt to pass for a free man--he was brought up to the farming business but will most likely offer himself as a shoemaker. Ten dollars reward will be given for the delivery of said fellow to me or confinement in any Jail with information so that I get him again. <BR>DORIS CANNADY.<BR>February 18th, 1818.
