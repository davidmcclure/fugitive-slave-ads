Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY on the 29th of March last, my Negro Boy SAM, aged about 19 years, pretty black, has a sulky look, and knits his brow very much when spoken to. He has a notable scar on his right eye-brow, occasioned by a stroke from a bridle bit. His clothes it is needless to describe, as it is believed he has a sufficient number of friends to clothe him in a way to prevent discovery. He went off without any cause whatever, about ten days previous, and was advertised in the Norfolk Beacon; but came in before the advertisement appeared in that paper. His elopement a second time I am much more at a loss to account for, unless it is not for receiving that chastisement which his conduct so justly merited. --I will give the above reward if taken up within this county, or 38 Dollars if taken up without, and secured so that I get him.<BR>James Borritz.<BR>Edenton, April 18, 1818.   tf609
