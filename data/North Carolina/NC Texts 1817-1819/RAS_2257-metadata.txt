Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 18th of June last, (but has remained in the neighbourhood till within ten days,) a negro man named DADER, about 22 years old, about 5 feet 9 or ten inches high, knockkneed, shews his foreteeth which are long, speaks lively. I have reason to think he has been carried off and is now on his way to Georgia. I will give Fifty Dollars to any person who will apprehend the man that has him in possession and secure the negro so that I get him again.<BR>ORIAS COLLINS.<BR>Wake county, Oct. 21.
