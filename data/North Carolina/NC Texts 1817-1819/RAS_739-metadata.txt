Transcript: 30 Dollars Reward.<BR>Ranaway on Friday the 3d January, my negro boy BEN, about 19 or 20 years of age, 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, yellow complexion, has a scar on his forehead, and a tumor or lump on his left eye-lid. It is probable he is lurking in the neighborhood of Edenton, as he was raised near that place, or in the neighborhood of Indian-Town, where he has formed an extensive acquaintance. The above reward will be paid if caught in this State, and secured in jail so that I get him, or FIFTY DOLLARS if taken without the State.<BR>Alfred Moore.
