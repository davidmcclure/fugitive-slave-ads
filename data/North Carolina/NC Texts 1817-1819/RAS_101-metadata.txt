Both of them was badly clothed when they left me. It is uncertain which course they will take. They have attempted to go off before by following either moving families or negro traders, but have been apprehended. Perhaps they may attempt to make their way good in the same manner-- Any person apprehending the said Negroes and confining them in any Jail, so that I get them again, or delivering them to me, shall be handsomely rewarded for their trouble and all reasonable expences paid.<BR>SAMUEL HENDERSON, sen.[senior]<BR>Sept. 5 91 8w
