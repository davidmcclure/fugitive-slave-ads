Transcript: 15 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber a negro man named BOB, about 27 years old, he is rather of a  slim-stature, of yellow complexion, 5 feet 11 inches high; when talking fast is very apt to stutter, speaks German very well, a blacksmith by trade, his little finger on the right hand is quite straight, some of his upper teeth on each side are cut; he is of a very proud, friendly address. He left me on the 24th June last, and the probability is that some white person may have assisted him to getting away.<BR> ROB'T.[Robert] BOYD. <BR>Lincoln County, Sept 11, 1817.
