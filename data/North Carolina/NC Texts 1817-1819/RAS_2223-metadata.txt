Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, in Louisburg, N.C. about the latter part of March or April last, a yellow negro fellow, named JOSH, about twenty eight years of age, common height, had permission by me to see his wife in Halifax county, N.C. and has not yet returned. He is an intelligent fellow, can read well, and probably write. I expect he will make for Norfolk, and try to pass for a freeman. It is probable he intends getting on board some ship. All commanders of ships are particulary requested to guard against he as he might impose himself on them. When he runaway he had on a blue homespun coat, pantaloons and a straw hat. He is a licensed baptist preacher. Any person who will deliver said negro to me or in any jail so I get him again shall receive the above reward and all reasonable expences paid.<BR>DAVIS BRYANT.<BR>Louisburgh, May 22.
