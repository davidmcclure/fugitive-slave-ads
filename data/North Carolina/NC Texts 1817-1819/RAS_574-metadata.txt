Transcript: TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.--Ranaway from the subscriber in Stantonsburg, Edgecomb county, on the 14th instant a negro by the name of DAVE, twenty-one or two years of age, black complexion, full round face, and five feet eight or nine inches high, rather slow-spoken, can read print a little, speaks a little French, or pretends to do so, sings French songs. I think he has a small scar, mole or mark of some kind near his nose or eyes, the toes of one foot, I believe the right, frost bitten, but nearly or quite well, he is a very good shoe-maker and tanner, worked five or six years in Armstead's Tann-Yard, Norfolk, had on when he went away a dark bottle green surtout coat, a blue round-a-bout jacket, nankeen pantaloons, a linen or cotton cambrick shirt, and a half worn wool hat, took with him a new pair of blue or black strip gingham pantaloons. I expect he will endeavour to pass for a free man and get on board some vessel, January last of Mr. Edmund Brooke of Norfolk, where in all probability he will try to get. Any person that will deliver said negro to me or secure him any jail so that I get him, shall receive the above reward and all reasonable expences paid.<BR> All masters of vessels are forewarned from concealing, harboring, employing, or carrying said negro off under penalty of the law.<BR> JAS.[JAMES] EASTWOOD.<BR>Stantonsburg, May 19, 1818.<BR> 56-4t.
