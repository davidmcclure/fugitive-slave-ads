Transcript: RUNAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 20th inst a Negro Woman named Tempy, rather small, and spare made--black complexion, with a scar on her forehead--she moves pert, and speaks short and quick. Had on when she went away, as striped homespun frock. She may have gone off with a William Rogers, as he was lurking about in the neighbourhood about the time she went off, and he was missing about the same time-- The said Rogers lives in Duck River county, State of Tennessee; the Negro was raised by his father in the County of Granville-- Any person that will deliver said Negro to me living in said County, or secure her in any Gaol, so that I get her again shall receive the sum of Fifteen Dollars, and reasonable expences paid: and if taken out of this State, full compensation with expences paid by me.<BR>HENRY FLOYD.<BR>May 24, 1817 23.3t
