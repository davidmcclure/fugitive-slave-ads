Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>WILL be given for apprehending or delivering to me, or securing in any job so that I get him again, my Negro Man<BR>SAM,<BR>who ranaway the last of August last past. He is about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high, very black, prominent eyes, wool on his head very thin, and about 24 years of age, though his appearance would discover him to be about 18 or 20. He formerly belonged to Mrs. Sarah Copeland, dec'd.[deceased] of this County. He had on when he ranaway white homespun pantaloons, an old blue broadcloth coat, and an old black hat, but has since changed it for a white one. He has numerous relations in Capt. Elliott's district, about 18 miles above Edenton. I will give the above reward if taken up within this state, or 30 Dollars if taken up without, and all reasonable expences paid, if secured as above.<BR>Benjaimin White.<BR>Chowan, Nov. 26, 1818.
