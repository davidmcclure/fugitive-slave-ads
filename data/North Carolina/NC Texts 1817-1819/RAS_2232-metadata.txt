Transcript: RUNAWAY, FROM the subscriber about the 25th of August last, a negro woman about 16 years of age, by the name of LETTIS, common size, not very black, when spoken to casts her eyes down and smiles, speaks very quick. As I have some reason to believe she will be run off by some person, I hope the good citizens of this county will keep a look out for said described girl. A reward of ten dollars will be given if caught in this county, and fifty if caught out of the State, or secured so that I get her again.<BR>A.F.MOSES.
