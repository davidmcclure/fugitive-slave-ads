Transcript: ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUNAWAY from the Subscriber on the 17th instant-2 negro men, GILES and CAESAR.<BR>GILES is about thirty one or two years of age, about five feeet ten or eleven inches high, a little yellow complection, has lost one or more of his upper foreteeth though seldom shows any of his teeth, has very litle bread, he has had part of his right great toe split off with an axe which makes the end sharper than the end of his other great toe, he has a down look when spoken to and I expect wears the marks of a severe whipping which he received in January last.<BR>CAESAR is about twenty nine or thirty years of age, about the same height of Giles, large and well made, very black, no other particular marks to describe. Giles is an artful and cunning fellow has by his ingenuity learned to read and write to a tolerable good hand and from the best information I can get he intends to write himself a free pass and try to get off and pass for a freeman. I think it very probable the he will write Caesar one & they will go off together, if they should make that attempt and are taken up and secured in any Jail so that I get them again or delivered to me in Lenoir county, N.C. I will give for them both fifty dollars of 25 for either of them provided they  are secured so as I get them again. Giles and Caesar are legally outlawed and all honest citizens are hereby solicited to be on their watch, & if they come in their way to take them dead of alive.<BR>CHARLES WESTBROOK.<BR>July 21.
