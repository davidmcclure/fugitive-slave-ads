Transcript: 30 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the night of the 3d instant, a Negro Man named TOM.? He is a little upwards of 6 feet high, between 30 and 35 years of age, his complexion somewhat yellow, his cheeks not full.? I do not recollect any part of his clothing, excpet a pair of black woollen pantaloons wove jeans, a new cotton shirt with button? holes worked in the bosom, and a wool hat nearly new.? A very good HORSE was taken out of my stable on the same night Tom absconded, and it is quite probable he was taken by said negro with a view ot follow his wife Milly, who I sold to John Siler-- Mr. Siler passed through Wadesborough in this State a few days since on his way to the south, with said Milly and others.? The Horse which was taken is a remarkably dark bay, would be taken for a black at a small distance.? He is 9 or 10 years of age, about 4 feet 10 inches high, well formed, rather a handsome Horse than otherwise, and branded with the letters I B on one of his shoulders.<BR>Any person who will deliver said negro Tom to me, or secure him in any way, so that I get him again, shall receive twenty dollars and all reasonable expences paid, and ten dollars for the delivery of the Horse.<BR>JOHN B. MEBANE.<BR>Chatham county, N.C. Nov. 6? 47 tf<BR>The Editors of the Telescope, Columbia, S.C. and Georgia Journal will give the above four insertions and forward their accounts to the Editor of the Register.
