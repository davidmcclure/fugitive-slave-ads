Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>ON the 5th inst. from the subscriber, living in Wake county, near Raleigh, a bright mulatto man, named JOHN--he is spare made, about 5 feet 10 inches high, about 25 years of age--his clothing when he went off, consisted of a snuff-coloured jacket of velvet and pantaloons of cotton dyed a snuff color; he took with him other clothing.  He is a sensible artful fellow, and will no doubt attempt to pass as a free man should he leave the neighborhood.  It is uncertain what place he will make for, but it is supposed he will travel northwardly.  He is an excellent Hostler, and has been in the practice of riding races.  Any person apprehending said fellow and delivering him to me, or securing him in Jail, so that I get him, shall be handsomely rewarded.<BR>All persons are forwarned harboring or carrying off said negro.<BR>ISAAC HUNTER, sen[senior]<BR>Wake, May 15, 1817.    21-3t
