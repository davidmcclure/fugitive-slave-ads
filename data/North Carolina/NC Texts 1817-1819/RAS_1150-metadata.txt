Transcript: LOOK HERE!!<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 29th of December last, my Negro man JOHNSON. He is a noted runaway, this being the third time he has eloped. Johnson is of a very bright yellow complexion, about 5 feet 9 inches high, stout and well made, 25 years of age, branded with the letter M, which scarcely can be discriminated owing to his exertions when first done to make it a settled sore; the under part of his left ear bit off by fighting (a very small bit). There is no doubt but he will attempt to pass as a free man of color, as he procured the pass of one Jerry Mayho, granted by the General Assembly of Virginia, (instead of North Carolina, as stated in a former advertisement;) the said Pass is on kid skin or parchment, (as stated by said Mayho) with several other papers of recommendation--one from John H. Hankes, as a waggoner, and others from men of the same name, besides some from Dennis Kendrick, of Warren county, and perhaps sundry other papers, with the supposed names of the most respectable gentlemen of this county, as he procured such when he ran away the time before this, which was the means of his detection, they being all signed by the same hand. This is to forwarn all masters of vessels and all other persons from harboring or employing said negro at their peril, as I am determined to put the law in force against such, if I come to the [k]nowledge of the same.<BR>I will give One Hundred Dollars Reward to any person who will deliver said Johnson to me safe at my house, or Fifty Dollars if detected and secured in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>GEORGE L. MOORE,<BR>Ledge of Rock Creek.<BR>March 28     (Apl. 18)        3m<BR>The editors of the Wilmington Recorder, Norfolk Herald, Petersburg Intelligencer, Richmond Enquirer, and Nashville Herald will insert the above three months, and forword their accounts to the Postmaster at Oxford, Granville county, North Carolina, for payment.
