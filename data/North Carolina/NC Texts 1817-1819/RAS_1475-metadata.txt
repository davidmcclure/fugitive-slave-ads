Transcript: NOTICE<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, residing in Mecklenburg county, near the Court-House, on the 18th April 1815, a negro man named PETER, 24 or 25 years of age, of dark complexion and common stature, has a scar on his left instep, occasioned by a cut with an axe, also a small scar over one of his eyes--he has an impediment in his speech, and is much confused when spoken to. I have reason to believe he is in the neighborhood of Tarborough or Halifax Town, N.C. I will give a reward of $150 for the delivery of the said negro to me, or secured in Jail so that I get him again.<BR>ROB'T[Robert] OLIVER<BR>October 3, 1818.<BR>2-3w pd<BR>N.B. I have reason to believe the said negro has a free pass, given him by a man in Salisbury.
