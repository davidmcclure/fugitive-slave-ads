Transcript: ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.<BR> For the apprehension and securing in jail in any adjoining states; a negro man slave by the name of ESSEX, the property of Mrs. Mary Jones, Halifax, North-Carolina, :--Should he be apprehended in this sate a reward of FIFTY DOLLARS will be paid for his being secured, so that his owner may get him, should he be brought home all reasonable expences will be paid in addition to the said reward. Essex is an excellent SHOE-MAKER; a deep mulatto, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, square built, speaks quick, full eyes, very fond of spirituous liquors, and when drunk is very apt to be insolent. As he absconded without any known cause, I am at a loss to conjecture what direction he may go.<BR>H.G. BURTON.<BR>Halifax, Jan. 15, 1818. 38--4t<BR> The editors of the Fayetteville Observer, Edenton Gazette, Norfolk Herald, Petersburg Intelligencer, and Nashville Whig, are requested to give the above three insertions, and forward their accounts to the Star office, Raleigh.
