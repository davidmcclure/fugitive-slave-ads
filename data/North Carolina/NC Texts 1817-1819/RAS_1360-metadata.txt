Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on Saturday the 14th inst. a yellow man named SAM, sometimes calling himself SAM CRAVEN and sometimes SAM FREEMAN, who has been for several years in the employ of Col. Cook, inkeeper[sic], as a house servant. SAM is not a bright mulatto--he is about 5 feet high, about 25 years of age, a stout, well built fellow--has a scar on one of his ancles[sic] occasioned by a cut received this Spring in hewing timber. He has a variety of clothing, of a good quality, in his possession, but a description of it is not practicable. It is imagined that SAM will make either for Petersburg or Wilmington, and the citizens of those places and the intermediate towns are requested to keep a look out for him. He rode off a small filley of a bright roan color, and had a good saddle and bridle upon her. A reward of THIRTY DOLLARS will be given for the arrest and confinement of said negro boy so that I can get him again.<BR>STEPHEN HAYWOOD.<BR>Raleigh, June 18, 1817.? 26-tf<BR>N.B. Sam can read and write. S.H.
