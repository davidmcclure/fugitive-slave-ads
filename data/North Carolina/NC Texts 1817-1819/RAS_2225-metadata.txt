Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWAD [sic].<BR>RANAWAY, about 3 years ago, from Mrs. Lowrie, while on a visit to her friends in Bertie, a negro girl named Delilah, of a black complexion, smooth skin, white handsome teeth, pleasant countenance, of tolerably large stature and about 22 or 23 years of age.<BR>She was brought, 4 years ago, by Judge Lowrie from a man of the name of Hill who said she was brought from Maryland, where she may possibly have gone.--But as she absconded with a negro, formerly waiting-man to a Mr. Anthony (who, I understand has since been taken) the probability is that she may still be harboured near Halifax or in Bertie.--As, by the bequest of her late Master, the right and title to said negro has fallen to me, I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver her to me in Charlotte, Mecklenburg county, N.C. --or Thirty Dollars to any person who will secure her so that I get her--and she shall be forgiven.<BR>DAVID DUNLAP.<BR>March, 1818.
