Transcript: 25 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY From the Subscriber two months since, a Negro man named JOHN: he is about 27 years of age, 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, of a dark complexion, has a lean face, round body, and is well made--speaks plain, can read tolerably well, and has a scar on one of his heels.  He has been lurking about Vine Swamp, in this county, and about my own neighborhood--and has frequently been seen with a gun, and other weapons for defence.  It is thought that he will endeavor to get to Portsmouth, in Virginia, where he was sold by Mr. H. Harboard, to Mr. Andrew Hurst of Duplin County N. Carolina.<BR>The above reward will be given to any person who will apprehend said negro & secure him in any Jail so that I get him.<BR>Should any person be disposed to purchase him, as he runs, I will take six hundred dollars, and give a good title.  He is an excellent ditcher, can hew, farm, or turn his hand to almost any thing.<BR>All masters of vessels, and others are forwarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law.<BR>FRANCIS GOODING.<BR>Lenoir County, 25th April 1818--tf.
