Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward. <BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on the night of the 28th Dec.[December] last, his negro man named JIM, (though he may alter his name) about thirty two years of age, five feet, 10 or 11 inches high, his colour somewhat of a yellow cast, and is a smooth glib spoken fellow.--Took with him a pair of linsay pantaloons, filled with white, two linsay jackets, one striped and one blue, an old great coat, a blanket, an old hat and an axe. It is probable that he may have gotten a free pass in some way or another, and that he will aim for the State of Virginia, where he was raised. I will give the above reward to anyone who will deliver the fellow to me, near Clemon's Town and Riddle's ferry, Rowan County, N.C or ten dollars if secured in any jail and word sent to me, so that I get him again. <BR>JOSEPH CLOUSE. <BR>January 6, 1819.    4-6w.
