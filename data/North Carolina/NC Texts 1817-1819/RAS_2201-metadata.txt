Transcript: Ranaway<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 10th inst. a negro fellow about 18 years of age, named JACOB, of dark complexion about 4 feet 10 or 11 inches high, well made and rather inclined to be bow-legged, and very active. He went off with a couple of other negroes, a negro man called Bill James, and a negro woman the property of Gov. Stone, who has her right ear cropped, and marks of whipping on her back. It is probable he may alter his name. A reward of Ten Dollars will be given for the said negro, if confined in any Jail so that I get him again, or Fifteen Dollars for his delivery to me living 12 miles east of Raleigh.<BR>JOHN E. BODDIE.<BR>Oct. 16, 1817.
