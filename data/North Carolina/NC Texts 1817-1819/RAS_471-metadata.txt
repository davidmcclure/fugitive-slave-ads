Transcript: 20 DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber in Rutherford county, North-Carolina, a yellow Man Slave by the name of REUBEN about 25 years old, 5 feet 6 inches high or near about it; he rode away a black Mare, which is old and sway backed.? Reuben has one short leg, and limps, one big toe cut off and is very freckled in the face; he is a sensible fellow, and I think it probable that he has procured a Pass by which he will attempt to pass for a freeman.? I know not where he will go.? I forwarn all masters & owners of vessels from employing or taking him on board, and will pay the above reward to any person who will secure him in any Jail so that I get him, or deliver him to me, and all reasonable expences paid.<BR>WM.[WILLIAM] GREEN, sen.[senior]<BR>January 20??? 58 3w
