Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANWAY from the Subscriber, on 15th July past, my negro man ROBERT, his clothes not recollected. I purchased him at Sheriff's sale as the property of John D. Carrington. Robert is about six feet high, black complexion, well made, has a down look, speaks short and is about twenty or twenty five years of age. I suppose this negro is harbored by some villian[sic] in Orange County, where he is lurking.--Any person who apprehends said negro and confine him in any jail so within this state, so that I get him again or deliver him to me living in Wake County two miles from fish dam, shall receive the above reward and all reasonable charges paid.<BR>TIGNOL JONES.<BR>August 3d, 1817.
