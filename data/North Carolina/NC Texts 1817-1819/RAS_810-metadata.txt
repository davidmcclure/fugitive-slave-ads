Transcript: 75 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, living near Windsor, in Bertie County, (N.C.) on the 26th of December last, a Negro Fellow about 23 or 24 years of age, named CAESAR,<BR>of a quite black complexion, well made, has a pleasing look, with his front teeth somewhat affected, a small white speck in one of his eyes, and about 5 feet 10 inches high, rather spare built and quite active. As this fellow is very artful and always dressed well and frequently wears a watch, it is impossible to say any thing respecting his clothing, except that he has a surtout coat of blue broad cloth. There is no doubt but he is making for the Northern states, under an idea of there having his freedom, or will ship on board at the first vessel whose Captain can be deceived, or is villain enough to secret him away, as he crossed the ferry from Salmon Creek to Edenton, and has not been heard of since. The above reward will be given to any person for apprehending and securing him in jail so that I get him again, & all reasonable expences paid. All masters of vessels are forbidden, under the penalty of the law, harboring or rendering him any aid. Any information respecting said negro will be thankfully received, addressed to the subscriber.<BR>Nancy Simmons.<BR>January 4th, 1819.    tf644<BR>The editors of the Baltimore Telegraph, and Norfolk Beacon, are requested to give the above reward, and forward their accounts to this office for payment.
