Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on Tuesday last, a Negro man named JACOB, formerly the property of James Spivey of Franklin county. He is about 31 or 32 years of age; of common size, is brisk to his movement, speaks quick, and has lost one of his upper fore teeth. It is expected he is in Franklin county-though I have some fears that the said negro may have been enticed away by some white person, with a view to run him to Georgia or elsewhere, and sell him. Reasonable compensation will be made to any person who will deliver him to me, or give me information so that I get him.<BR>JOSIAH DILLARD.<BR>Raleigh, April 8, 1815.
