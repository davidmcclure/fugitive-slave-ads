Transcript: 50 DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber living on Lime Stone Creek, Duplin County on the 30th of August, three Negro Men, named SAMPSON--JOE and BILL. Sampson is about 50 years of age, 5 feet 3 or 4 inches high, dark complexion, thick set from his hips up, and below rather slender; had on when he went away a Tarpolin Hat, and a homespun Jacket and Trowsers: Joe is about 30 years of age, full six feet high, black complexion, & slender made, the middle toe on his right foot is off--had on when he went away, a striped round Jacket and a new furd[sic] Hat.--Bill is about 20 years of age, five feet high, very black, slender built, dress not recollected. They all speak very broken English, not being long in the country. I suppose they will make for some seaport Town, and try and get on board some vessel, either at Newbern, Swansborough, or Wilmington. I will give the above reward of Fifty Dollars to any person that will apprehend said Negroes and deliver them to me in Duplin County, or secure them in any Jail in this State, so that I get them again, and all reasonable expences shall be paid, or a proportionable part for each of the above described fellows. <BR>All persons are forwarned from harbouring, employing or carrying them out of the state, under the penalty of the law. <BR>Easler Killpatrick. <BR>Duplin County, Sept. 6th.--4t. (p. d.)
