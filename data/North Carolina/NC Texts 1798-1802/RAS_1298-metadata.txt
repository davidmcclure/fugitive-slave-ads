Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, the 6th of August last, a negro man named WILLIAM, about 21 years old, a thick-well made fellow, inclining to be corpulent, his complexion rather light, full dull eyes, the whites inclined to be yellow, his cloathing[sic] I cannot describe, as he had several sorts.  He had a pass from me to go to Raleigh, but has never appeared there--He can read and perhaps write, and [with the] assistance of some villian, my procure a free pass.  I expect he is lurking about Halifax town, as his father and mother live near Willie Jones' seat. He was formerly the propery of Alexaner [illegible] I will give the above reward to any person that will secure him in any jail so that I get him again.  All masters of vesels and others, are forwarned from harbouring or taking him off at their peril.<BR>THOMAS SUMNER.<BR>Warren county, September 1.
