Transcript: RAN away from the Subscriber, AARON, a stout, likely, black fellow, about 5 feet ten inches high, and 26 years old. He has been branded, by a former master, on one side of his face and commonly ties a small handkerchief under his chin, to cover the brand. He formerly worked in the Lebanon Swamp, and has a wife in Nixonton. If he is not lurking thereabouts, he has probably got a free pass, and found employment as a shingle weaver, on the Virginia side of the Dismal; a Mr. Williams, Mr. Carpron and Mr. Doughty, are particularly requested to have him apprehended, if he should apply to them for work. I will give TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS to any person who will deliver him to me. <BR> THOMAS FITT. <BR> Lazy-Hill, Feb. 20, 1799.
