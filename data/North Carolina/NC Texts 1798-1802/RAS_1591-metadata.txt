Should the said runaway not return home before Monday next,--from that time I do hereby declare him outlawed, and will give five dollars to any person who will deliver him to me dead or alive.<BR>It is expected he is harboured by some person in town, as he has been frequently seen lurking about the streets at night. On Monday he was seen drunk in a dram shop next door to Mess. Fontaine, & Co. kept by a Negro fellow, who it is probable received stolen goods in payment for rum.<BR>I do hereby offer a further reward of ten dollars to any person who will give me information which may lead to the conviction of any person so offending in future. All masters of vessels and others are forbid harbouring, employing, or carrying him off, at their peril.<BR>A. HALL.<BR>March 6.
