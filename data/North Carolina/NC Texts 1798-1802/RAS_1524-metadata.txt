Transcript: RAN away from the subscriber, a Negro Woman named PEGGY, and three s[m]all Boy Children. Jack, about six years old, Simon about three years old, and the youngest about two months old. As I hear they have been seen near Wilmington, and that my undutiful wife is at the Brick House, she may attempt to send them away, I therefore forwarn all commanders of vessels and attempt to send them away, I therefore forwarn all commanders of vessels and others from buying them from her the said Mary Sessions, or taking them away on her request, under pain of having the rigor of the law executed aganist them. I also forwarn all persons from harbouring my said wife or assisting her to keep from her real home, where to me she is always was welcome, on any pretence or means whatsoever. If attention is not paid to my civil caution I will soon try to get redress by the laws of my country. <BR> ABSALOM SESSIONS
