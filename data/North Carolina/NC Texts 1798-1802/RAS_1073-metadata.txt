Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber in September last, a likely negro fellow named DICK, about twenty-four years of age of a yellow complexion, about five feet eight inches high, stout and well made. I have reason to believe the above fellow is (and has been ever since he runaway[sic] from me) in Gates county, where I believe he was raised by a Mr. Webb, from whose son (lately a professor in the University of North Carolina) I bought him in July 1799.  I will give the above reward with all reasonable expences, to any person who will deliver the said fellow to me in Hillsborough, or thirty dollars for securing him in any jail in this state so that I get him again.<BR>WIL.[William] KIRKLAND<BR>Hillsborough, July 2 1800     30 4D
