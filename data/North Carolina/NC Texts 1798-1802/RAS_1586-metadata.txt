Transcript: RANAWAY from the Subscriber about the 10th of September last, a likely Negro Fellow, named DAVIE, aged about twenty years, tall and well made, of a dark complexion; had on his right [illegible] a remarkable scar made by the cut of a whip.  The fellow was raised [on] my property, and he has never to my knowledge, [been] 30 miles from home, and from that circumstance I am unable to say where I suppose he is gone.  I will give Fifty Dollars reward to whoever will deliver said Negro to me five miles below the town of Tarborough.<BR>JOHN SPELL.<BR>Edgecombe county, Oct 7    05 3P
