Transcript: ELOPED from my plantation on Saturday last, a negro fellow named ABRAM, a Carpenter,-generally known about Wilmington as a Fidler, and has been frequently employed without my consent and to my great loss as such.-I therefore give this notice of his being Run-away, and that he carried off his cloathing and sundry tools. I forbid any person employing him either as a Fidler or in any other capacity, or harbouring or entertaining him, as I am determined to prosecute whoever does either, to the utmost rigour of th Law-and I do hereby promise a Reward of FIFTY DOLLARS, to be paid on conviction, to any person that will give me notice of the person so harbouring or employing him; and ONE DOLLAR besides all expenses, for having him confined in Wilmington or any other jail in this state. <BR>Masters of vessels are forbid carrying him off. <BR>Nov. 26 J. BURGWIN.
