Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD. <BR> Ran away from the subscriber, on the 13th of June last, a negro fellow named PETER, about forty years of age, five feet ten or eleven inches high, stout made, and has lost some of his upper teeth. He formerly belonged to Govenor Caswell, and afterwards to Mr. William White, of Kinston, and is well known in that neighbourhood; he has a wife at Christopher Lawsen's, in Duplin county, and has frequently been seen about that place, and on his way to the neighbourhood of Kinston, since he went off. The above reward will be paid to any person, who will bring him to me, or lodge him in any goal, so that I get him again. <BR> ROBERT DONNEL. Strabane, Lenior County, Dec. 10.
