Transcript: RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 15th of February last, a Virginia born slave, by the name of King.  26 years of age, about 5 feet 10 inches tall, yellow complexion, very white teeth, has a scar on the top of one of his feet, occasioned by the cut of an ax; he rather lisps in his common way of discourse; he is a square well made fellow; he took with a white negro cotton jacket and overalls, a new oznaburg shirt, an old drab great coat, with a yellow velvet cape to it; a pair of Nankeen overalls, and a short mixt virginia cloth coat, a pair of shoes and a black hat.  I expect he will lurk about the town of Tarborough, Hogston, or Petersburg, in Virginia, being well acquainted at all of those places.  He will probably endeavour to pass for a free man, as he did when he went off before, about eight years ago, and was taken up at Tarborough.  Any person that delivers him to me, or sends me word so that I get him, shall receive an adequate reward, and have all reasonable expences paid.<BR>JOHN SHORT.<BR>Northampton county, March.     46
