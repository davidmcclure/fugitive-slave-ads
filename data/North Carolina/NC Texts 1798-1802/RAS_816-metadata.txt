Transcript: A REWARD of Ten Dollars will be paid to any person who will deliver into the goal of Wilmington, a certain negro man named JOHNY, a fellow I purchased from Mr. John Waddell.--He is of a yellow complection, about five feet ten inches high, strait and well made, steps rather short and quick when he walks, has lost some of his fore teeth. He is about thirty-five or forty years of age. It is probable he may be about Mr. Waddell's plantation, having a mother and uncle there. If he returns of his own accord he shall not be punished, and may work in town.<BR>GEORGE GIBBS.<BR>June 13.<BR>107--3
