Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward,<BR>IF taken up and brought to the subscriber, or eight dollars each, or five dollars each, if confined in gaol in that I get them, and all reasonable expence paid.<BR>Run-away from the subscriber, on Tuesday, the second instant, three negro men; one by the name of ARTHUR, middling tall, inclined to be yellow, small in the waist, branded on one of his cheeks with a small key; had on a short home-spun jacket, and long breeches of the same, dyed yellow; carried off with him a blue long coat; as for his other cloathing[sic] I cannot describe them.  SAM, a small black fellow, dress[sic] in the same manner, only all white; and carried with him a sky coloured blue coat.  TOM is a middle sized negro, not very black, nor not much inclined to be yellow, about forty years of age, some grey hairs on his head; his jacekt and breeches home-spun, made like unto the others.<BR>ARTHUR is about 28 years of age, and Sam about 22 or 23.  I expect they may have changed their clothes in order not to be known.  I suppose they may aim for Norfolk, or some sea port in this state, I therefore forwarn all masters of vessels,  and all other persons, from harbouring or carrying them away at their peril.  They may have got a free pass for what I know from some rascal or other.<BR>500 3    SAM.[Samuel] WESTRAY<BR>Nash county, near the court house, Feb. 9
