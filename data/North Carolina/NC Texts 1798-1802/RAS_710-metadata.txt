Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscribers living in Person county, on the 20th of June last, two Negro men slaves, one by the name of SION, about 5 feet 10 inches high, 22 years of age, of a very yellow complexion, a smiling countenance, has a small vacancy between two of his fore teeth, a small scar on each wrist, as is done by handcuffs; had on when he went away, a tow and cotton shirt, fancy cord breeches, and a snuff coloured broadcloth coat; it is likely he may change his name and endeavour to pass for a freeman. The other by the name of PETER, about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, 23 years of age, of a common complexion, very knock kneed; the right side of his right ankle is so twisted that he treads mostly on the out side of his foot; had on when he went away a cotton shirt, Osnaburg overalls, an old red hair shag vestcoat, and country grey cloth coat. Whoever will apprehend said Negroes and deliver them to either of the subscribers, or secure them in any gaol, and give information so that they may be had, shall receive for each slave ten dollars. <BR>DRURY JONES,<BR>WILSON JONES,<BR>Person County, N.C. July 9.      70 6
