Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward or Twelve and an[sic] Half for Each.<BR>RUN-AWAY from the subscriber on Sunday the 10th instant, two negro men by the name of TOM, one about thirty three years of age, about five feet ten or eleven inches high, has remarkable large white eyes, and a scar on his left foot just above his toes, occasioned by a Cart wheen when small, has a very large scar on one of his buttocks, which he says was burned; he had on when he went away a new homespun shirt, filled with cow and aold green plains jacket, pached[sic] on the shoulders with cotton cloth; a pair of negro cotton trowsers, dyed a kind of purple, & a very indifferent hat, except that he has got a new one, his other clothes was[sic] a new green plains over jacket, a blue mixt home made waistcoat, and a pair of cotton overalls, and shirt of the same, was raised in Greenesville county, near Hick's-ford, Virginia, by Mrs. Mary Wick, and perhaps may try to get there, but I am more inclined to think he will aim for Norfolk: he is tolerable black and has no beard.<BR>The other negro is about twenty eight years of age, five feet seven or eight inches high, remarkable black, has very little appearance of beard, a very long face, and a very large head.  Has a fresh scar over his left eye, he has a large scar or swollen place on one of his sides,just under his breast, which he says was occassioned by the horn of an Ox some years ago, he had on when he went away, a negro cotton over jacket, a black mixt home made waistcoat, and trowsers of the same of his jacket, and had a kind of purple dark mixt ribbed stockings, and a sorry hat, he might carry away with him considerable of other clothes, which I cannot describe, I expect he will aim for Norfolk or Princess Ann, as he was raised by the late Dr. John Seas.<BR>EDWIN DANCY.<BR>N.B. If taken out of this state, 50 dollars or 25 for either.<BR>January 12, 1803.    96
