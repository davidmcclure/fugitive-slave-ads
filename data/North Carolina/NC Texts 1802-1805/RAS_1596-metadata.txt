Transcript: RANAWAY, <BR> FROM the Subscriber, living in Raleigh, on the night of the 23rd instant, a Negro Boy named SAM, about 18 years old, about 5 feet 7, well built of a good countenace, stutters much when speaking. He has with him two blue coats, one short and one long, a new hat with a small brim, and a bundle of cloathing. It is expected he will aim for Norfolk, as he has once before tried to get there. I will give a generous reward and pay all reasonable charges to any person who will bring him to me or secure him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>HENRY H. COOKE.<BR> Oct. 26, 1804.<BR> N.B. He ran away this summer a year ago & was apprehended at Mosley's Ferry on Roanoke and was confined to Warren jail for some time.
