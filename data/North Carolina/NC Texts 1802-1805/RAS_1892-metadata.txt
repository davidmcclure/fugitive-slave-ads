Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>ABSCONDED from the subscriber about two months and an half since, without the least provocation, Negro JOE, a Taylor by trade, 26 or 28 year of age, of low stature, very black, pitted with the small pox, speaks Creole French and broken English, commonly wears rings in his ears, & is marked on his right breast with the letters P.P. almost illegible. He has a wife at Mr. Henry Halsey's, near Wilmington, at Catfish or on Rockey-point, and no doubt is harboured at one of those places and works at his trade.  I will give ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for information which may lead to conviction of  his being harboured by a white person, TWENTY-FIVE if by a Negro, or the above reward for apprehending and delivering him to me, or lodging him in jail so that I get him.<BR> I will also give a reward of TEN DOLLARS, for apprehending a negro man named GEORGE, who ran awat from Charleston, S. C. about 8 months ago--he was formerly the property of James Morand, who sold him to Francis Fontaine, & Co. and at present belongs to Peter Goodtown, of Charleston, S. C. George is about 30 or 32 years of ag, 5 feet 8 inches high or thereabouts, slim made, and very black--he has a wife at capt. James Walker's plantation, near Wilmington, where it is supposed he is harboured.<br/><br />Masters of vessels and all others are cautioned against harbouring, employing or carrying the said negro away.   PETER WISS.<BR>Wilmington, April 21.
