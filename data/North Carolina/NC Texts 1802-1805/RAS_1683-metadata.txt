Transcript: RUN away, on the 25th of last October, a Negro wench named DINAH, who is about 5 feet 3 inches high, and pretty stout, of a yellowish complexion, thick under-lip which projects more than is usual, has an upper foretooth broke out, the loss of which is apparent when she speaks--and has a large bushy head of hair. I do suppose said wench is lurking about or within a few miles of Wilmington; yet I have reason to believe she is some where up the North West.<BR>I will give a reward of Eight Dollars and pay reasonable charges to any person who will bring said wench to me, or lodge her in Wilmington gaol, so that I may get her.<BR>Samuel Black.<BR>North-East, Feb. 1, 1804.    70 4w
