Transcript: Thirty Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN away from the Subscriber, on the 2d instant, a Negro Woman by the name of Jenny, and her two Daughters named Docia and Elsae.<BR>Jenny is about 35 or 40 years old, of a yellowish complexion, of middling stature, but rather slim made. She is a very artful, cunning woman; and as she can write a little, it is probable she may have wrote a Pass for herself and daughters.<BR>Docia is about 15 years old, a very bright Mulatto (almost white) her Hair is very coarse, and of a brown colour. She is of low stature.<BR>Elsae is about 12 years old, a dark Mulatto, with very black Hair. There is a black spot on one of her cheeks, occasioned by a small burn from a candle.<BR>I am quite uncertain as to the route they will take; but as they were brought into this part of the country from Fayetteville by Mr. Kerr, who was some years ago a Professor in the University of the State, I think it probable they may endeavour to get there.<BR>I will give the above Reward, and all reasonable expences, to any person who will deliver them to me in this place, or for securing them in any Jail in this State, so that I get them again.<BR>W. KIRKLAND<BR>Hillsboro' July 5, 1804.
