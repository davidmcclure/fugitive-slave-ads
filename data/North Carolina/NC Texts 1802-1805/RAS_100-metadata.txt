Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>From the Subscriber in Chatham County.<BR>A NEGRO Man called Harry, tho' he may change his name. He is a stout well built fellow rather inclined to be corpulent and weights near 200 weight.ï¿½ He is about 27 years old, a good fiddler and appears fond of musick[sic], but carried no instrument with him. He had on when he went away, a big coat of a dark grey color, a black coat, a very good Fir Hat, a pair of striped Overalls, a pair of grey mixt Overalls &c. I lately purchased him of Hector M'Neil, of Person County, who brought him from the Eastern Shore of Maryland about three weeks past. He will probably aim for some Sea-port Town in order to pass by water to the place he came from. I will give Twenty-five Dollars to any Person who will deliver him to me, or secure him in any Goal giving me notice thereof. He says he was bred to the Ship Carpenter's business.<BR>JOHN DABNEY.<BR>4th of October, 1804.
