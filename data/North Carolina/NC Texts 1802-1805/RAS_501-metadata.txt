He has been seen not long since in Johnston County, near Smithfield, where he has Connexions[sic].  The above Reward will be paid any Person who will deliver the said Negro Ned, or a liberal Reward to any Person securing him in any Goal, and giving information, so that I get him again.<BR>JAMES JONES.<BR>Franklin Co.
