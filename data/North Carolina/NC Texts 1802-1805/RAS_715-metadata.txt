Transcript: Twenty-Five Dollars <BR>REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, in Wilmington, on Tuesday the 29th of March last, a negro man named FRANK, 21 or 22 years of age, about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, rather slender made, tolerably black, and likely, has very little beard and that chiefly on his upper lip, and appears never to have been shaved. He was formerly the property of Dr. S. Halling, and lately of John McAuslan, of whom I purchased him. I suspect he will endeavor to get on board some vessel in order to make his escape. All matters of vessels and others are cautioned against harbouring, employing or carrying him away under the severest penalty of the law. I will give the above reward to any person who will take up said runaway and deliver him to me, or secure him in jail so that I get him. I will also give a reward of Fifty Dollars for information that may lead to conviction of his being harboured or concealed on board any vessel or elsewhere.<BR>DAVID GREER.<BR>Wilmington, April 7, 1803.
