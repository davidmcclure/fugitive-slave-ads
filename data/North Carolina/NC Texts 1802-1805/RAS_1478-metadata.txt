Transcript: One Hundred Dollars Reward. <BR>A YOUNG Fellow belonging to me, named JOHN, sometimes called JOHNSON, and at times calling himself JOHN HILL, went off from this place about three or four weeks since. -JOHN is about five feet five inches high, twenty-three years old tho he appears much younger-he is somewhat of a copper colour, being the son of a mulatto man and a negro woman. His features are generally ugly , his eyes remarkabely large and prominent-he is sensible and shrewd, civil in his manners and plausible in conversation--he served his time with a Cabinet-maker, and understands the business of the Windsor Chair-maker- he is very ingenious, and well acquainted with the use of the Joiner's tools. JOHN reads and I believe can write a little. What induced him to go off, or where will be his destination is not know, but it is expected he has gone in some vessel to some of the Northern ports, or perhaps to Charleston. <BR>I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver JOHN to me, if he is taken out of the state, or if taken in the state, will give Twenty-five Dollars on his being delivered to me. <BR>W.H.HILL<BR>N.B. The Fellow BALAAM, a limping Fellow very tall and very black, advertised some time since, who ranaway witner before last, is not yet taken. I will give Fifty Dollars to any person who will deliver him to me. Balaam is probably either in this neighbourhood or on the Nothwest.<BR>W.H.H.<BR>Wilmington, N.C. May 4th, 1802.
