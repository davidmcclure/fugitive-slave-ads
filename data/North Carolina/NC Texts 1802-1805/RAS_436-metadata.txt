Transcript: 15 or 25 Dollars Reward<BR>RAn away on Monday the 10th September last, a NEGRO MAN named SPENCER.  He is about 25 Years old, low and tolerably well made, and weighs, I expect, 140 wt. pretends to be a little deaf.  This fellow is very well known in Nash and Franklin by the name of Cooper's Spencer.  John Cooper, his former Master, moved from Franklin last Winter, and I am told has lived as an Overseer for M.D. Williams, Esq. Member of Congress, the present year, in Caswell County, N.C. where it is though by some he has gone.  Others say he has had some pretensions to freedom, and perhaps may endeavour to pass as a freeman, though he is quite dark.  As it is unknown to me where he may aim.  I will give 15 Dollars to any Person who will bring said Negro to me, if taken up in Nash or Franklin.  If taken out of these counties, I will give 25 dollars for a Delivery of him to me,<BR>DAVID SILLS.<BR>Nash County, N.C. Oct. 8, 1804.
