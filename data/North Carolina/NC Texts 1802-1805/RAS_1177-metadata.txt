Transcript: Ninety Dollars Reward.<BR>ELOPED from the Hermitage on the 10th of this instant, the following Negroes, belonging formerly to John Burgwin, Esq. but they are now my property, viz.<BR>ABRAM, a carpenter, who is well known in and about Wilmington as a a Fiddler; he took off with him his wife named HANNAH, about 34 years of age, and their daughter a likely young girl of about 15 years of age named JESSEE and two younger children, boys, named MARCUS and NEGER. <BR>NED, a Blacksmith,a likely young fellow, about 22 years of age, is tall and slender made, and smooth faced, has a wife at Fayetteville, the property of Mrs. Vance, to which place it is probable he may bend his course. <BR>JEM, a likely young fellow, about 26 years old, he has a wife the property of Mrs. M. Jones, in Wilmington named Grace, who will no doubt entertain him; also two of his brothers.<BR>LONDON and ZEBB, the first is about 10, the other about 15 years of age, LONDON is a very smooth faced likely boy, ZEBB is rather awkward and scrawny. <BR>JOHN, is a likely smooth faced young fellow, is tall and slender, and 22 years old, he was hired last year to Mrs. Halsey at Green Fields, and has a wife there named Amy, who I suppose will harbour him.<BR>AJAX, an old lusty fellow, smooth faced, speaks plain and is upwards of 50 years old.<BR>All the said Negroes (the last excepted) are young and likely, and all speak very plain English, and are extremely plausible in deception; Abram has a rupture, but is not withstanding active and strong. <BR>Ten Dollars will be paid for each, to any person apprehending any of them, on their being delivered to John Lord, Esq. in Wilmington; or Ninety dollars for the whole in proportion, on being delivered as aforesaid or secured in any goal in this state so that the subscriber may have them.<BR>GEORGE C. CLITHERALL <BR>January 20.--ts.
