Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the Subscriber, on Saturday night the 2d instant, one Negro Man named Sam, and one Negro Woman named Kate.  Sam is of a yellow complexion, about 5 feet 8 inches high, slender built, about 28 years old, has two of his fore teeth a little defected, and has a bushy head, a little inclined to Indian.  He carried away with him sundry home cloaths, some striped and some mixed, also one striped Swansdown waistcoat, made a few days before he started.  Kate is of a dark complexion, about 30 or 35 years of age, of a common size.  She has several of her fore teeth out.  She carried away with her sundry cloathing, mostly homespun and that striped.<BR>I have some expectation they will try to get to Norfolk or Baltimore, in one of which towns Kate was raised.  Sam has no connection, but at my house, having partly raised him myself, and at this time own his father and mother.  Kate I purchased of Mr. Thos.[Thomas] Hancock, of Smithfield in Virginia, about two years ago.  Any person who will deliver the said Negroes to me, or to John Stephens, jun, of Smithfield, N C shall receive 25 dollars, and all reasonable expences paid, if taken within the State ; and it taken without the State, 50 dollars.  Or any person who will apprehend and lodge them in any Jail, so that I get them again, shall be well rewarded for their trouble.<BR>Any information given to me, or to Mr. John Stevens, jun. in Smithfield, of the route they have taken, will be thankfully recieved.  All masters of vessels, and others, are cautioned against harbouring, employing, or carrying them away, at their peril.<BR>BARNABY BULLS.<BR>Johnston County, N.C. 10 miles<BR>below Smithfield, March 4
