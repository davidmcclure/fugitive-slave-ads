Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward  <BR>RAN away from the subscriber, seven miles from Rockey-Point Feery, on the North-East River, a mulatto man named ISSAC, 20 or 21 years of age, 5 feet 6 1-2 inches high, and tolerable well made, had on when he went away a white linen shirt, homespun overalls and a round blue cloth jacket, and took with him some striped Homespun. He has been seen in Wilmington, from whence I expect he will endeavour to make his escape. All masters of vessels and others are hereby forwarned from harbouring, employing or carrying him away at their peril. I will give the above reward for taking us Isaac and delivering him to me, or securing him in jail so that I get him. <BR>JOHN M'CLENDON. <BR>New Hanover County, <BR>July 21, 1803.
