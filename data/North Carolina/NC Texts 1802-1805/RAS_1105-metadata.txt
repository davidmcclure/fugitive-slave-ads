Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR>Ran-away from the subscriber on the 5th of October, a likely negro man named<BR>POLLADORE.<BR>He is about thirty-five years of age, of a yellow complexion, about five feet five or six inches high, stout made and well set--he has a large scar on one of his hands, I believe the left, between his thumb and fore finger, occasioned by the stroke of an axe; he has also scars of the like kind on one or both of his feet--he has a lump on his right arm a little above his wrist which he got hurt in fighting.<BR>The above described Negro named Polladore is legally outlawed, and if he does not surrender himself and return home, then any person may kill and destroy the said slave, by such means as he or they may think fit, without incurring any penalty or forfeiture thereby: the above reward will be given for the said slave, in whatever situation he may be brought to me, or so secured that I shall get him.<BR>All masters of vessels and others are forwarned from harbouring, employing or carrying away said negro. <BR>EDWARD GRIFFITH.<BR>N.B. He has in all probability obtained a Pass, and may change his name: but whatever story he may tell, I hope it will make no difference if he answers the above discription[sic].<BR>E.G.<BR>Craven County, June 23, 1803.
