Transcript: Eighty Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN-AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 6th instant, a mulatto man named<BR>EPHRAIM,<BR>about five feet ten inches high well proportioned; aged twenty nine years. His dress I am unacquainted with except a ruffle shirt; and big coat; carried off with him a set of Shoemaker's tools; he has a down cast countenance, when spoken to  he is very apt to pick his nose; his hair is very kinky and carries his age remarkably well.--When he eloped he carried off a likely Sorrel Mare, near fifteen hands high, six years old, has had a sistuals [sic?]; branded on each side with a ring and with two R's on the rising side. On the right Arm has been snagged, the scar quite discoverable. I am adoubtful this fellow will attempt to pass with him. Whoever will deliver said fellow shall be entitled to a reward of Fifty Dollars, and for Negro and Mare, Eight Dollars.<BR> RICHARD TOMOSSON.<BR> May 28, 1804.<BR> The Printers of the state of Tennesse will be pleased to publish the above advertisement.
