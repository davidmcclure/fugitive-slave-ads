Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, about the first of November, 1797, a MULATTO SLAVE, named JIM.  When he went away, he was about 20 Years old, about 5 Feet 8 or 9 Inches high.  He is rather a whitish coloured Mulatto, square made, wide across the Shoulders and Hips; his Face long, and his Nose rather flat, short Feet, and wide across the Toes.  He is a cunning, artful Fellow, very talkative, and a quick Hand to knit, sein[skein?] or net.  I suppose he has lately changed his Name, and is passing for a freeman. <BR>Any Person who will deliver the said Slave to the Subscriber living in Lenoir County, or at Raleigh, during the Sitting of the present Assembly, shall receive the above Reward. <BR>Nov.[November] 17, 1802,    WM.[WILLIAM] GOODMAN.
