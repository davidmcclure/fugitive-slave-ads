Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the Subscriber on the 31st of March last, a Mulatto Man by the Name of Ben, about twenty Years of Age, five Feet eight or ten Inches high: He is a very lively active Fellow, spare Made, and is mixed some with Indian Blood.  I expect he will try to pass for a free Man.  Had on when he went away a coarse Wool Hat, a Homespun Coat, Vest, and a Pair of Overalls, and took with him a short Coat, a Pair of Small-cloathes and a white Pair of Cotton Stockings.  Also took a Pair of old Saddle-bags.<BR>He was raised in Granville County, North Carolina, near the Head of Nut-Bush Creek.  He has a Wife in said County, and some Relations in Halifax; and it is likely he may aim to one of those Places.<BR>Whoever will apprehend said Mulatto, and deliver him to Lewis Reavis, Esq. of Granville County, or secure him in some Jail, and send me Word, so that I get him again, shall receive the above Reward, and all reasonable Charges paid.<BR>ARTHUR HARRIS, Jun.<BR>Near Montgomery Court-house.<BR>Montgomery County, April 24.
