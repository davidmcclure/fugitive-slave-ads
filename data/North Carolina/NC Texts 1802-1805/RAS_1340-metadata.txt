Transcript: Thirty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber on the 26th July last, a Negro Man Slave named Abram, about 5 feet 10 or 11 Inches high, twenty-nine Years of age, black, of a trim-make, with long Arms and Hands, which, when he walks, hang straight down by his Sides; he is a little round-shouldered; he is a very likely and artful Fellow, can work at the Cooper's trade. He has a Scar on his right knee, occasioned by the cut of an Axe, and another on his left Buttock, occasioned by a Burn when a Child. I expect he will attach himself to some Villain and endeavour to pass for a free Man. If he should leave this County, I expect he will change his Name and deny his Master, if taken at a distance from home. Since he left me, he hath been apprehended and broke Custody. I would therefore recommend that if he should be apprehended, he should be secured in such a Manner as to prevent his having any Opportunity of escaping, as this will be his first Study.<BR>I will give the above Reward to any Person who delivers him to me in Caswell County, N. Carolina, or one half, if secured in Goal so that I get him, and all reasonable Charges paid.<BR>ALEX MURPHEY.<BR>August 258th, 1804
