Transcript: RAN AWAY from the subscriber on Monday the 26th of November last, a yellow Fellow named JACK, about five feet eight inches high or thereabouts, twenty-two years of age, full faced, and stout made--carried away with him considerable clothing, too tedious to mention, which will enable him to change his dress often--he had on when he went away a pair of shoes made with leather strings, which may be notable, and had with him a Dutch blanket and a brown great coat.<BR>I suppose said Negro will endeavour to secret himself at Mr. Swann's quarter or in Wilmington, as he has an extensive acquaintance in the county. <BR>As the said Fellow may possibly procure a free pass, I hereby caution all masters of vessels and others, against harbouring, employing or carrying him away.<BR>Whoever will apprehend the said slave Jack, and deliver him to me at my plantation on Long-creek, or confine him in jail and give me notice thereof, so that I [get] him, shall receive Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>THOMAS LEWIS.<BR>New-Hanover county<BR>Dec. 3.--3wpd.
