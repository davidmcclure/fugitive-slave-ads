Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN away from the Subscriber's Plantation near Raleigh, his NEGRO MAN, DICK, who is about 40 years old, stout-made, 5 Feet 10 Inches high; has a remarkable large Beard, and has two of his Fingers on the left Hand contracted.<BR>This fellow I purchased of Mr. Adam Haywood, of Edgecomb County, in whose neighborhood he has several relations; and Lovatt Burgess, Esq. of Halifax County, owns his father and mother. He was seen on the road leasing from Raleigh to Tarborough, a few days ago, and will, I have no doubt, attempt to secrete himself in the vicinage of one of both of these Gentelmen's Farms. The above Reward will be given for delivering him to me in Raleigh, or Ten Dollars for securing him in Gaol, so that I get him.<BR>WILL.[William] POLK<BR>July 24.
