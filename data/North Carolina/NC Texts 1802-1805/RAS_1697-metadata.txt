In a former attempt to escape from service, he shipped himself aboard a vessel as a cook,  and passed as a freeman by the name of Jack, it is therefore proabable he will alter his name, & endeavor to leave the state by water.- A very generous reward will be paid for delivering him  at Belvedere or lodging him in jail, and ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, on conviction of any person harbouring him on board a vessel, with intent to carry him out of the State or port. If he be harboured on the shore the offender will be prosecuted with the utmost severity, and an handsome reward paid on proof being made of the offence.<BR>BENJA. SMITH<BR>Wilmington, June 3.
