Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.--Runaway from the subscriber, on the 11th instant. A NEGRO FELLOW named OLIVER, tolerably stout built and well made, aged about 27 years but looks young for that age, having very little beard, about 5 feet 8 inches high: he is a tolerably black fellow, with a very pleasing, smiling countenance, is very polite and courteous in his address, has rather a soft, effiminate voice, and has a short quick-step when he walks. He has for several years past employed as a waiter in the public hours kept at this place and carried with him sundry articles of very good cloathing which cannot be described. He took off with him a dark, chestnut sorrel HORSE (at that time much sun burnt and in low order) about  4 feet 10 or 11 inches high, with a white face, and a scar under his right eye, about 7 or 8 years old, I will give the above reward for securing the above described negro brought home and a reasonable compensation for such information as may enable me to regain the horse. As he ran-away without any cause whatever, I am apprehensive he has been furnished with free papers, and will make his way towards Newbern, or some other seaport town.<BR>THO.[THOMAS] B. LITTLEJOHN.<BR> Oxford, Granville County, 29th Sept. 1814. <BR> THe Editors of the Newbern Federal Republican and Charleston Courier, will please insert the foregoing three times each, and transmit their accounts to the Minerva office for payment.
