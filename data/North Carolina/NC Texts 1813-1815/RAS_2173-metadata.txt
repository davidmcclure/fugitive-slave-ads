Transcript: RUNAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on or about the 24th of this month, my mulatto man TOM, about 23 years of age--he is a well set fellow, is a bright mulatto, full faced, of a pleasant countenance, and has a scar over on of his eyebrows, from the kick of a horse. He is an excellent carpenter, and has acted as foreman in that character. I am induced to believe that a young man has tempted him off with a view of carrying him to the State of Tennessee, or he may attempt to pass as a free man. I will give a reward of fifteen dollars if he is taken within thirty miles of Lewisburg, or a reward of 20 dollars if he is taken beyond that distance, and secured in Jail, or brought so that I get him, and all reasonable expences paid. I will moreover give a reward of fifty dollars for the apprehension of the thief, so that he be prosecuted to conviction.<BR>RICHARD WARD.<BR>Franklin County, Jan. 28, 1815.
