Transcript: RANAWAY <BR> FROM the subscriber on the 24th inst. a Negro fellow named BOSTON, thirty-six or seven years old, about five feet six inches high, has a scar on his nose. He is very artful and cunning, speaks plain and distinct, and has some marks of the whip on his back. Had on when he went away, a blue cloth coat with plated basket button, over which he had an old, drab cloth coat much worn, a pair of old fair top boots lately foxed and soaled; he has been employed in driving a waggon for seven or eight years, and it is expected that he will make for the North, and endeavour to pass for a waggoner, as he took with his whip with him, and knowing that a number of waggons has passed through this place lately for that quarter. Any person that will take up said fellow, and secure him in any gaol so that I get him again, shall be handsomely rewarded. <BR> JOHN MATTHEWS. <BR> Fayetteville, Jan. 28, 1814. 7 tf
