Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward. <BR>  RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 2d instant a likely Negro man, named HENRY, of dark complexion, thirty-two or three years of age, about five feet eleven inches high, has a sulky stubborn look, talks short and appears diffident when spoken to; had on when he went away a negro cotton coat, pantaloons and vest homespun, no other clothing recollected. I presume he is lurking about in the county of Nash, either at Mr. Michael Collins or amongst the Negroes belonging to the Mr. Hilliards of said County. The above reward of twenty dollars will be given to any one delivering said negro Henry to me living within three miles of Louisburg, Franklin county, or ten dollars to any person apprehending said negro and lodging him in any gaol within the state so that I get him again. <BR>  NAT. HUNT. <BR>  January 9, 1814.
