Transcript: Thirty Dollars Reward.  <BR> RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 11th instant, a Negro fellow named Oliver, tolerably stout built and well made, aged about 27 years but looks young for that age, having very little beard, about 5 feet 8 inches high; he is a tolerably black fellow, with a very pleasing smiling countenance, is very polite and courteous in address, has a rather soft, effeminate voice, and has a short quick step when he walks. He has for several years past been employed as a waiter in the public house kept at this place, and carried with him sundry articles of very good cloathing which cannot be described. He took off with him a dark chestnut sorrel horse, (at that time much sun burnt, and in low order) about 4 feet 10 or 11 inches high with a white face, and a scar under his right eye about 7 or 8 years old. I will give the above reward for securing the above described negro fellow, so that I get him again; all proper expences if brought home and a reasonable compensation for such information as may enable me to regain the horse. As he ranaway without any cause whatever, I am apprehensive he has been furnished with free papers, and will make his way towards Newbern, or some other seaport town.  <BR>  THO.[Thomas] B. LITTLEJOHN.  <BR>  Oxford, Granville County, Sept. 29th, 1814.
