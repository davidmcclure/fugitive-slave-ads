Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward. <BR>  RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 27th of June last, a Negro Man named CURTIS, 6 feet high, 23 years of age, slim made, with a small scar on his forehead, was raised in Guilford county, and being able to write, no doubt will try to pass as a free man; he was sold to me by the name of Harper.
