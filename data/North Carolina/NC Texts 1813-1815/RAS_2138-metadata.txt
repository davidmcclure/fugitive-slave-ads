Transcript: Forty Dollars Reward.  <BR>  RUNAWAY from the subscriber on July, 1813, a Negro man named RANDOLPH, about twenty years of age, of common size, and dark complexion, and his hair a little inclined to be redish, has tolerable large four[sic] teeth, and rather scattering--He was born in Virginia and has several times attempted to get back but has been taken up, and I think it quite probable he has gone some other way, probably towards Cape Fear. I will give the above reward to any person that will deliver the said negro to me, or secure him in any jail so that I get him.  <BR>  NICHOLSON WASHINGTON.  <BR>  Wayne County, June 7, 1814. 24-4t.
