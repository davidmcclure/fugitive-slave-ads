Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN AWAY from the Subscriber, in Edgecomb County, on Friday the 9th instant, about 13 miles above Tarborough, 4 miles south of Tar River, my NEGRO FELLOW SAM.  He is about forty years old, very black, and of tolerable size.  One of his upper fore teeth split, which makes them rather stand apart.  He took with him a new homespun shirt and trowsers, two blankets, and sundry other cloaths not recollected.  He pretend[s] to be a doctor, and it is probable he may attempt to pass for a free man.  I know not what course he may go.  I will give the above reward, if delivered to me, or confined in any jail, so that I get him again.<BR>JANE WILLIAMS.<BR>July 17.    3t
