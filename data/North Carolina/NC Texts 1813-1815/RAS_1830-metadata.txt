Transcript: Ten Dollars Rewad.<BR>RUN-AWAY from the Subscriber about three weeks since a mulatto fellow named GEORGE REDOUT alias MORRIS. This fellow is a dark coloured Mulatto, pitted a little on the face with the small pox; is about five feet four inches high, and about twenty-four or five years old; he is a West Indian by birth, and it is more than probable he may attempt to pass himself for a free man--He is well known at Wilmington and at Fort Johnson, where he was hired last year to Mr. Halsey. Any one who will apprehend that said fellow or secure him in jail so that I get him, will receive the above reward by applying to <BR>THOMAS C. RESTON.<BR>August 21.--tf
