Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber about the first day of March last, a negro man called MARCH, about five feet 8 or 9 inches high, slim made, of dark complexion, about 23 years old, thin visage and full mouth, and his forehead is very full, and has stoppage in his speech; said negro was raised on Whiteoak River, near or at Mursdin's Mills, and sold young to Mr. Boswell Smyth on Trent River, N.C. and from said Smyth to Mr. James Huston on Neuse River Fort Barnwell, and from Mr. Hutson to Frederick Baker in Lenoir county, N.C. and from Mr. Baker to the subscriber; the father of said negro March belongs to Mr. Wm.[William] Mitchell about 6 miles above Newbern on the Neuse road; his having so great acquaintance it is difficult to say which of these places may be most likely to find him; but I expect he is lurking about Mr. Mitchell's where his father is, or on the south side of Trent river near Mr. Gaton's Mills is very likely he may be as he has been once caught there; it is said when he is out he tried to pass for a free man, which is likely he may do now. Any person who may apprehend said negro and confine him in some jail so that I get him, or deliver him to the subscriber in Lenoir county, N.C. shall receive the reward. <BR> JAMES ENGRAM. <BR> August 12, 1814.
