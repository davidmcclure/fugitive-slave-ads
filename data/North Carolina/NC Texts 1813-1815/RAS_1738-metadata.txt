Transcript: Runaway or was Stolen<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 29th of last month, a Negro Man, about 35 years of age, yellow complexion, his right ear, I believe cut off; he took no clothing but what he wore, which was a coat of cotton warp and black yarn filling, black yarn breeches, common shoes and socks, he is about 5 feet high, well made, is a sensible fellow, and I expect will endeavor to pass for a free man.--From information he had a good deal of money. Any person that will apprehend and deliver him to the subscriber, living in Granville county, on the Ledge of Rock creek, shall be handsomely rewarded.<BR>GEO.[George] L. MOORE.<BR>February 3, 1815.<BR>6 3t pd<BR>N.B. I am apprehensive that he may have a free pass
