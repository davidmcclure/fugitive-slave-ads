Transcript: 30 DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 8th inst. two Negroes, SAM and AMY--Sam in an African fellow, thirty five or forty years of age, speaks English tolerably plain, and about a middle stature. Amy is about 21 or 22 years of age, a small woman, yellow complection and is marked with the small pox. One pit on the end of her nose, appears as if a small bit was taken out, keen black eyes, delicate apperance, having been brought up a house servant--she will aim for Norfolk from whence I have lately brought her. She ranaway from me in July last, twelve miles west from Murfreesborough, being on my way home from Norfolk, she reached Norfolk in about two weeks, where she was committed to Jail. The fellow will no doubt accompany her--They will aim for the following [illegible], Fayetteville, [illegible]borough, Raleigh, Murfreesborough, or Winton. The probability is, that Amy will leave Sam after a few days traveling, under the idea of passing for a free person, as she is a yellow girl. I will give the above reward to any person who will secure them in any Jail in this State so that I get them again, or if taken separately twenty dollars for Amy and ten dollars for Sam. <BR>JOHN M'RAE. <BR>Sneedsborough, Anson county, Jan. 9, 1815.
