Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RANAWAY<BR>FROM the Subscriber some time in February last a negro fellow by the name of GREEG; <BR>He is about 30 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches high, very black, & walks with his toes very much out, he was formerly the property of Dorkens Wilkinson. I think it is probable that he is lurking about in the neighbourhood of Mr. Enoch Master's on South River. I will give the above reward for him to be delivered to me or secured in jail so that I get him. <BR>Masters of Vessels and all others are hereby forwarned from harbouring, employing or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law. <BR>ELIZABETH BRAY. <BR>Jones County, July 23d, 1814--3w.
