Transcript: RUNAWAY<BR>from the subscriber, between the 27th and 28th of August last, a likely NEGRO WENCH, by the name of RUTH; 25 years of age, of a middling stature, upon the yellow order, and has a tolerable bold countenance, supposed to be pregnant. She can speak Dutch or English. She can weave or do any sort of farmer's work: she carried away, a cotton habit, and two petticoats grounded with black and white, also a black cambric bonnet.<BR>It is quite likely that she was taken off and sold clandestinely: if this is the cause those that are supposed guilty of the crime are of the following description. One of a middling stature, sandy complexion, and tolerable handsome; the other a tall, spare made with tender eyes, and homely. If any person or persons have secured said negro, so that I get her again, shall be entitled to a reasonable reward by me.<BR>DAVID FOX, sen.<BR> Living near Carter's mill on Rocky River, Chatham County, N.C.<BR>Nov. 10, 1814.
