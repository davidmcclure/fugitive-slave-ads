Transcript: Twenty Five Dollars Reward. <BR>  RANAWAY from the subscriber on the 12th instant, a Negro man named MOSE,  about 27 years of age, 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, of a pretty stout body, but rather small legs, walks somewhat sluggishly and inclines forward when he walks, has lost one of his under teeth, and has a scar on the under side of his left arm, made by a sickle in reaping; he was bought in the winter of 1802 or 3 of John Felton, of Perquimans county, whither it is probable he may now endeavour to go. It is believed that he can write, and that he has perhaps furnished himself with a pass. The above reward will be given for the apprehension of said Negro if secured in any jail in this state, (so that the subscriber gets him again) and information be immediately given to the subscriber living near Cowper Hill, Robeson county, N. Carolina. <BR>  JOHN M'LEAN. <BR>  August 24th, 1813.  35 2t pd<BR>  N.B. He is a very artful fellow, should he be apprehended particular care should be taken to prevent his escape.
