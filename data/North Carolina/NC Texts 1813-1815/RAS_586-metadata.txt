Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber about the first of Jan. last, a negro man by the name of BILLY; he is about 34 years of age, by trade a Carpenter, and has a large scar on his breast, occasioned by a burn received some years ago.--A more particular description is deemed unnecessary, as he was raised in the County of Halifax, where I am well persuaded he is now lurking, and is well known. Said Negro has a wife at Mr. Kemp Plummber's Plantation, near the town of Halifax. I will give the above reward for the apprehension and delivery of said negro to me in Raleigh.<BR>A.S.H. BURGES.<BR>March 7, 1815.<BR>10-tf.
