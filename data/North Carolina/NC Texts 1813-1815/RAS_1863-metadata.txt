Transcript: STOP THE RUNAWAY.<BR>Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>DESERTED from my service, on the 6th of August, inst. my negro man SPENCER, a hatter by trade. Spencer is 36 years old, carries his age well, he is a sleek black, stout-built, of a common heighth[sic], round shoulders, rather a down look, appears humble when spoken to, wears his hair very neatly carded.  Had on when he went off, a large brim black hat of his own make, a pair of white cotton overalls and shirt and a striped cotton waistcoat.  His intention is to pass for a free man, and may perhaps change his clothes and alter his name; and may have procured from some villian a free pass.  I am inclined to believe he will make for the Catawba river in the extremeity of this state, where he has a brother and sister living who belong to the heirs of Ketchen Prim, and to whom he formerly belonged, and from whom he was purchased by Gen. Wm.[William] Arrington about 15 years ago.<BR>I will give twenty-five dollars reward to any person who will deliver said negro to me in Nash county, or ten dollars reward to any person who will secure him in any jail in this state, or the United States, so that I get him again.<BR>LAURENCE BATTLE.<BR>Nash County, N.C.<BR>Swift creek, August 31, 1814.    81--3t
