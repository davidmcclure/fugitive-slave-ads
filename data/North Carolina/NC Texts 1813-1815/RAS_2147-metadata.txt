Transcript: Fifteen Dollars Reward. <BR>  RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 6th of Sept. a yellow negro named CLEM, about 40 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, well made, has a large naked place on the back part of his head, occasioned by a burn, he was born in Granville county, it is probable he will attempt to pass for a freeman, as he is a bright mulatto--Perhaps he may have a pass or a recommendation of some sort. The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver the said Clem to me, or secure him in any Jail so that I get him again. I rather suppose that the said slave was carried away by a man named Nath'l.[Nathaniel] Thornton, as he left here about that time. <BR>  G.D. HOLCOMB. <BR>  Huntersville, Surry county, Sept. 12, 1814. 38 3t
