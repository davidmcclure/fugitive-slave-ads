Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward. <BR> RANAWAY on the 19th of February last, a Negro man named KIRT, between 20 and 30 years old, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, very black, cunning and artful, can write a tolerable good hand, it is probable he has a pass with a number of names counterfeited to it, and me may attempt to counterfeit the county seal, speaks quick, is a little hollow eyed, rather knock-kneed; had with him a pair of leather breeches, a black fulled linsey coat, other clothing not recollected.--It is possible he will change his clothing and make use of many devices to deceive the people, as he has a great deal of assurance; he has no motive in running away, but to get free, and may attempt to go to the Ohio or Delaware, or the lower end of this State. The above reward will be given by the subscriber, living in Guilford County, N.C. for the delivery or information of said runaway so that I get him again. <BR> LEVIN AYDELOTT.  <BR> March 30.  14 5t pd
