Transcript: 100 Dollars Reward.<BR>RUN-AWAY or Stolen from the Subscriber on Sunday night last, a Mulatto Girl named EDAH, about 20 years of age, very light complexion, modest pretty countenance, red cheeks, and a remarkable handsome figure. A further description of her is deemed unnecessary, as she is well known by many gentlemen both in the Northern and Southern States, who have put up at my house; she having attended as a house servant for many years past. I have some reason to believe that she has been enticed off by some person, as [illegible] the treatment she received she never would have absconded without some great inducement, having always been used more like a free person than a slave. I will give the above reward if apprehended without the State or 50 dollars if taken within and delivered to me, or secured so that I get her again .<BR>JAMES WOOD.<BR>Hertford, Perquimans County, N.C.<BR>August 23d, 8114 [1814]  61--4w
