Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber in June last a Negro man by the name of DICK about 30 years of age, 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, stout and well made, and a sensible fellow.--He has a wife at Common's plantation, near Raleigh--he has no particular mark by which to know him, except rather a squinting when he laughs, and speaks pert. I suspect he passes a part of his time in Johnston county, and the balance in Wake. I will give the above reward for his apprehension and commitment to any jail, so that I get him again.--It is not improbable he may attempt to pass as a free man.<BR>CYRUS WHITAKER.<BR>Wake County, Aug. 20, 1813
