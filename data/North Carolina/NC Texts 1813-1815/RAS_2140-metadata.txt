Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR>  RANAWAY from Wadesborough, Anson county, about the first of June, a Negro Man named JIM--He was raised near Edenton in this State, by a Mr. Halsey, and brought to Fayetteville by a Mr. Mills Everette, about the fall of 1804 or 5, and sold by him to the subscriber. He is about midding stature, of a round compact muscular make, somewhat bowlegged, of a very black complection, his nose flat, sunk cheeks, thick lips, with a fore tooth or two out, of a gruff, sullen aspect when serious, fluent in discourse with a quick and rapped utterance, particularly when a little intoxicated which he is very subject to, is a black smith by trade, but expert at any business, particularly at the saw. Having had the chief management of the shop, it is supposed he is well supplied with money and clothes. He is an artful, sensible, quick fellow, and may change his name to appear as a freeman. The above reward will be given if taken up out of the county, and secured in any Jail so that I can get him again; ten dollars if apprehended within the county-in either case if the captor choose to bring him to the subscriber at Wadesborough, he will be paid besides the reward all reasonable expences. If he resists, a reward of five dollars will be given to any person killing him in the attempt to take him. <BR>  JAS.[James] DOUGLAS. <BR> June 27, 1814.         27 6t
