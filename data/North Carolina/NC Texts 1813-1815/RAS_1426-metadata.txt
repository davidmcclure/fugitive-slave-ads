He is about 23 years of age, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, large and well formed for his height : has a piece bitten out of his right ear-- And carried off with him a striped linsey homespun big coat, other clothing not recollected.  Having lately purchased him from a gentleman from Tennessee, I am induced to believe he may attempt to get to the Greek nation of Indians.  A more minute description of him is not recollected.<BR>Any person who will confine him in jail, and give me notice in my residence, or deliver him to me, shall receive the above reward.<BR>ALFRED M. BURTON,<BR>61--3t
