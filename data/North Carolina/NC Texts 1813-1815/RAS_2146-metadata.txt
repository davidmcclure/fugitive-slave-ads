Transcript: Fifteen Dollars Reward. <BR> RANAWAY from the subscriber, living in Cabarrus co. on the 7th of June last, a Negro man named Frank, about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, 27 or 28 years of age, strong and well made, of a yellow complexion, has the letter O on his forehead, and is a little lame in the left leg, had a pleasant countenance, talks plain and intelligible, but when interrogated closely, speaks in a stammering manner. It is likely he will make for William Bush's in Montgomery county, of whom I bought him about 8 years ago. All persons are forewarned not to harbor him, as I am determined to prosecute them agreeably to law. Whoever will take up said Negro and secures him in jail so that I get him again, or bring him home, shall be entitled to the above reward and all reasonable expences paid. <BR> JOHN BAKER.  <BR> Sept. 10, 1814.   38 3t
