Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber some time in April last, two negroes, a man and woman, the fellow named NED about thirty five years of age, of a light complexion, talks broken, has lost some of his fore teeth, slow of speech has a down look, and a small scar on his nose, he is about five feet eight or nine inches high, he took with him a quantity of clothing, among which was a dark coloured yarn home spun great coat, a light mixed do. with a black cape, his other clothing not recollected--His wife as he calls her, named BETTY, is about seventeen years or eighteen years of age, a light complexion, thick and trunchy and is very likely, her clothing not recollected. The above describes negroes I have reason to believe were stolen and sold to Solomon Nevil of the county Orange, by a James H. Harrison as he said that was his name, but I suspect will be sent off by said Nevil, as he refused to let me see them. Any person apprehending said Negroes and will deliver them to me in Northampton County, N.C. shall receive the above reward, or half price if they are secured in any gaol so that I can get them. This therefore may forwarn any person buying of them as I shall ever contend for them as my property. <BR>HOWELL EDMUNDS. <BR>For ELIZABETH EDMUNDS. <BR> Northampton, Oct. 4, 1814.  41-4tp.
