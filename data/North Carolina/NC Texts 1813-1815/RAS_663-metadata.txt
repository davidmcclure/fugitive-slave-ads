Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, about the 15th November, JERRY, a negro man, 5 feet 11 inches high and 30 years old-queues his hair, which is three or four inches long, and has two plaits of nearly the same length hanging down from the fore part of his head, and has lost, I believe, one of his fore teeth.

The above reward will be given for delivering him to me, or Ten Dollars for securing him in any gaol so that I get him.<BR>Wm.[William] Polk.<BR> Raleigh, Dec. 17
