Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR>WILL be given for apprehending and lodging in any Jail in this state, so that I get him, my mulatto man named-Abram, otherwise Abram Patrick or Abram W. Patrick, he is well known about the Town of Wilmington, on Levingston Creek in Brunkswick County, on the River through the County of Bladen, in and about the Town of Fayetteville, and on Rockfish Creek, in the County of Cumberland, where he was raised with Mrs. Kirkpatrick his former owner. Abram is remarkable for being a tall man with rather thin visage, hair fine and inclined to curl about the neck, with a scar as from a Bite under the left cheek bone, and for conversing upon mechanicks[sic] on which he is very speculative--he is a good Mill Wright and House Carpenter, and is particularly expert at putting water on the wheel of a Saw or other Mill--he can write and will probably attempt to pass himself as a free man--persons are warned how they are imposed on, as in case of employing him without permission, the penalties of the Law will be enforced. Abram has been out since the 6th day of June and has been seen in the neighborhood of Mr. John Waddle's in Bladen County--should he come in and deliver himself up within the course of this month his offence shall be pardoned otherwise I shall take the necessary steps to outlaw him.<BR>JAMES W. WALKER<BR>July 10.--tf.
