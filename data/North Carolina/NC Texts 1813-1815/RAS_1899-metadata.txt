Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN away from Jacob Hadley, on the 7th day of September last, a mulatto Man by the name of JIM, 21 years old, 5 feet 7  or 8 inches high, spare made, with a scar on his head, perhaps one in his face, has a sly down look when spoken to.  He took with him a large fierce yellow Dog, also a quantity of fine clothes, a broad cloth snuff-colored surtout coat lined with white homespun.  It is supposed that some person has given him a Pass, or likely he may attempt to pass for a free man.  The said Jim belongs to the heirs of Wm.[William] Ramsey, dec'd[deceased].  The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver the said Jim to me, or secure him in any Jail and give timely notice.<BR>Jesse Meacham.<BR>Chatham county, Oct. 16    89 3w
