Transcript: DESERTED <BR>  FROM my service on the 6th instant my Negro man SPENCER, a Hatter by trade, stout and well built of common height, very slick and black, round shoulders and a down look, wears a large brown hat, made of racoon fur and wool; he is quite humble and pliant in conversation, wears his hair neatly combed, is a very neat and decent looking Negro. His intentions will be to pass for a freeman, and will alter his name. I rather expect he will make his way for the Catawba river, in the extremity of this State, where he has a brother and sister, the property of old Kitchen Prince or his heirs. Spencer formerly belonged to the said Kitchen Prince, and was purchased of said Prince by Gen. Arrington, about 15 or 18 years since, at which time the said Prince was a resident of this county. Any person who will apprehend said Negro and secure him in any jail within this State or the U. States, so I get him again, or deliver him to me in Nash county, will be handsomely rewarded all expences paid. <BR> LAWRENCE BATTLE . <BR> Nash county, Swift Creek, August 13, 1814.  34 3t
