Charles is about 20 years of age common height, dark complexion, well made, rather bow-legged, very active, a sly down look, one upper tooth out before, he was raised in Fredericksburg, Virginia, but has lived several years at Halifax Court-House in Virginia, it is probable he will aim for Fredericksburg or Halifax Court House. Peter is of common height rather heavier built than Charles, 25 or 30 years old, rather lighter complexion than Charles; he says he was raised near the Federal City, and that he was known by the name of Peter Sanders, and says he was born free, he no doubt is with Charles aiming for the Federal City-the above reward will be given by the subscribers for both or 20 dollars for the delivery of either, or secured in Jail so as the owners can get them again, given under our hands this 25th day of July 1814.  <BR>   W.W. CHAFFIN,  <BR>   ELISHA PURDON.  <BR>   It is supposed that those Negroes have 20 or 30 dollars with them.
