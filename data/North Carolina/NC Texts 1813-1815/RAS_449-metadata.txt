Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward. <BR> RUNAWAY from the subscriber a Negro man named FIGG, five feet 7 inches high, yellow complexion, about 25 years of age, lost one of his upper fore teeth, has a sulky look, had rings in his ears when he went off; and I rather expect is lurking about Edenton, as I understand he got some clothes which he left there when returning from Elizabeth, where he used to carry on the baking business; it is most likely he has obtained a pass, as he is very artful. All persons are forewarned from harboring, employing, or carrying him out of the state under the penalty of the law. I will give the above reward and all reasonable expences to any person that will bring him to me, or secure him in goal so that I get him again. <BR> George Reid. <BR> Newbern, Sept. 29, 1814.
