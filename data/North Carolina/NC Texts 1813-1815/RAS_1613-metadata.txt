Transcript: Ranaway.<BR>FROM Mrs. Warren's in Wake county, on Saturday the 3d inst. my negro man PHIL, very dark complected, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high has some grey hairs, and is knockneed. He is an excellent carpenter, and a pretty good fiddler. I have reason to believe that he has gone off with a base white woman by the name of SALLY POWEL. A generous reward will be given to any person who apprehend the said Negro and deliver him to the subscriber, 3 miles north of Col. Sutherland's store.<BR>HENRY GOODLOE.<BR>July 6, 1812.
