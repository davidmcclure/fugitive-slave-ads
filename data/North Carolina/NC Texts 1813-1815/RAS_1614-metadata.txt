Transcript: RANAWAY.<BR>FROM the Subscriber in Warren County, on the 17th ult a Negro Woman named FANNY, about 39 years of age, 5 feet 6 inches high, of a yellow complexion, some of her foreteeth out, she has a scar on one arm (not recollected which) occasioned by the cut of a knife.  She carried off a number clothes, some of them pretty good, amongst which there is a silk dress of purple changeable color, and a great coat of yarn homespun of a Brown color.  She is a tolerable sensible negro and will no doubt try to pass for a free woman.  I will give a generous reward to any person who will deliver her ot me, or secure her in jail, so that I may get her again.<BR>JOHN B POWELL.<BR>Warren County, May 5, 1814<BR>64--3t
