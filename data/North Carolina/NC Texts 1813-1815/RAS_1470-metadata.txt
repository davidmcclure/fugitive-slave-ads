Transcript: 100 Dollars Reward.<BR> RUN-AWAY from the subscriber on the 1st of January last, a Negro Fellow named GEORGE, about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high; about 36 or 7 years of age, and a very artful cunning fellow; a shoe maker by trade; has lately been seen in the vicinity of Elizabeth City; at which place and at the General Bridge I expect he is harbored or employed. Likewise, about four weeks since, Negro JOSEPH, about 5 feet 6 inches high; has a pleasing look; a nail cutter by trade, but has followed the sea for some time past; about 25 years old, but looks much younger; commonly wears ear rings, and is a likely well smart fellow; had on when he went off a purple homespun woollen jacket and trowsers; but has several suits of clothes with him. I expect this fellow will attempt to get to the Northward, and no doubt has procured a free pass for that purpose. His connexions live in the neighborhood of Capt. James Hathaway, where (if not off) I expect he will be harbored. Neither of the above named Negroes have any marks recollected on them, except that of the whip.  I will give Twenty-Five Dollars for either if taken within the State and delivered to me; or Fifty Dollars for either if taken out of the State and brought to me at this place; and the further sum Thirty Dollars for proof to conviction of any white or black persons harboring either of them. <BR>Nathaniel C. Bisssel. <BR> Edenton, May 2, 1814.  419
