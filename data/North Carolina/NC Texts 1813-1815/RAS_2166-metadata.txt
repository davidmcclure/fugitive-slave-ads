Transcript: RUNAWAY<BR>FROM Mrs. Warren's in Wake county, on Saturday the third inst. my Negro man PHIL, very dark complected, five feet six or seven inches high, knock-kneed, has a few gray hairs, and is an excellent carpenter and a pretty good fiddler. I have reason to believe that he has gone off with a base White Woman by the name of Sally Powell. A generous reward will be given to any person who will deliver the said Negro to the subscriber 3 miles north of Col. Sutherland's Store, or secure him in jail so that I get him again.<BR>HENRY GOODLOE.<BR>July, 6.
