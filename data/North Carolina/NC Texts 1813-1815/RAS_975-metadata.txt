Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 15th inst, two Negro men, one of the name of CHARLES, the other POMPEY.  Charles, is fully 6 feet high, stout and likely, rather of a yellow complexion ; on close inspection it will be found, one of his upper teeth is somewhat of a blue colour, his clothes were of homespun cloth, his hat was very much worn, the breaks in which were pasted with putty.  I purchased him of Col. Boykin of Isle of Wight Ct. House, to the neighborhood of which place he will attempt to go.  Pompey is about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, very black ; when spoken to has a small impediment or speaks confused, of a sullen countenance, his shirt and trowsers, of course homespun cloth, he was purchased of Col. Reddick, of Suffolk, Virginia, to the neighborhood of which place I expect he will attempt to go.  The above reward, will be given any person who will secure them in any Jail, so that I get them again, or twenty five dollars for each of them.<BR>WILLIAM ANDERSON.<BR>Caswell County Aug. 18, 1814.    2m--79
