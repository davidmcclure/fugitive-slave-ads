Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR> IN September last, from no other cause but the consciousness of deserving punishment, a negro fellow, Frank, about 5 feet 8 inches high, thirty years of age, ranaway from my Exeter plantation, four miles below Wilmington. He is slim, round faced, talks much during which time he is generally smiling and shakes his head--understands sawing in a mill very well. Having an uncle at Fayetteville, named Macklin, belonging to Mr. M'Millan, is is said he has been harboured in the neighbourhood; and as he was Colonal Read's waiting man he might travel up the country where he was acquainted, particulary in Guilford, of which some information has been given.--Also that he was about Hillsborough. A handsome reward will be given, agreeable to the trouble, for lodging him in any jail in the state, or delivering him at Belvidere, and the above reward on proof to conviction of his being harboured by any white person.<BR>BENJ.[BENJAMIN] SMITH.<BR>December 19th, 1810.
