Transcript: RUN-AWAY from the subscriber on [illegible] evening the 13th inst. my Negro man FRANK. He is about 5 feet 3 inches high, very black, about 24 years of age, and has a very notable scar over his right eye, occasioned by the kick of a horse, when he was young. He is a tailor by trade, can beat the drum extremely well, was born in the Island of Guadaloupe, to which place he has lately threatened to go, speaks French pretty well and is a very artful and insinuating fellow, particularly when in liquor. He left in the [illegible] when he went off his hat and shoes; but has a variety of clothing it is deemed unnecessary to particularise any of them. He will, I have reason to believe, make for [illegible] Elizabeth-city or Norfolk, for the purpose of effecting his escape, either toward Northward or the West-Indies. I will give a reward of 5 Dollars, if taken within this County, 20 if taken without, and 40 if taken out of this State, and secured so that I get him. <BR> All masters of vessels and others I strictly forbid harboring, employing, or carrying said fellow off under the severe penalty of the law-which is Death. <BR> Joseph Manning.<BR> Edenton, Oct. 14, 1811.
