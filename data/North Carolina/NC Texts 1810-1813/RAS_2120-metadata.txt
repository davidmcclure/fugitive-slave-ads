Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, near Milton in Caswell County, North Carolina on the [illegible] inst. a bright mulatto Man by the name of LUKE about five feet nine or ten inches high, twenty two years old, with a scar over one of his eyes and one on the side of his head near the crown. He is a fellow of pleasing countenace and rather inclined to stutter; particularly when closely interrogated. He had on when he started a mixed homespun Coat and pantaloons, and carried off with him a fiddle and a shoe knife. It is probable that he may endeavour to pass for a free man as I am informed he was accompanied by a white woman by the name of Milly Tucker, about the age of twenty one years, light hair and pale complection, rather swarthy, she is a low set woman and rather stoops in her shoulders as she walks, blue eyes, with her toes turned in, daughter of Hezekiah Tucker, of the above County. I will give thirty dollars reward for the said fellow delivered to me in Milton and pay all reasonable expences, or to have him secured so that I get him again; or fifty dollars for him and the woman.<BR>THOMAS CONNELLY.<BR>Milton, 6th Nov. 1811.
