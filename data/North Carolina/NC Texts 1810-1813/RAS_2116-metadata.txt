Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber about the 30th of July last, a Negro man named SQUIRE, about 24 or 25 years old, five feet eight or nine inches high, stout made, and of a very black complexion--He has a loud voice, and remarkable large fore teeth, they are very wide and he shews them much. He has a tolerable large scar on his left arm between the wrist and elbow, caused by a rising-and his left great toe is stiff occasioned by a burn. Said Negro has a brother living at Raleigh, and I rather suspect that he may be in the neighbourhood of that place. I will give ten Dollars reward to any person who may apprehend and deliver him to me, or confine him in Jail so that I get him.<BR>WILLIS HINTON.<BR>JOHNSTON COUNTY, August 13, 1811.
