Transcript: 30 Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 18th inst. my negro man TOM, formerly the property of Thomas W. Thompson, of this County. He is about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, of a light complexion, his toes very scraggy, as much so that when barefoot, his track is very not able. He is well known in the County and in Edenton, and is supposed to be lurking in the latter place. Any person that will deliver him to me, or confine him in gaol so that I get him, shall receive the above reward.--All masters of vessels and others are strictly forbidden from employing or carrying him off at their peril. <BR> Micajah Bunch.
