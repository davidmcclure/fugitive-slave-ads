Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, living in Orange County, N.C. about two weeks ago, a NEGRO MAN named Ephraim.  He is about twenty five or six years of age, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, stout built; has a scar on one of his elbows, made by a scythe.  His cloaths were, a blue coat and black overalls, with some others not perfectly remembered.-- He is a very artful fellow, and will no doubt procure a false pass and call himself a free man-- He was brought from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he may probably try to return.  He says he has been used to the water.<BR>I forewarn all persons from harboring said Negro, or conveying him away.  I will give the above Reward to any person who shall bring him to me, or Ten Dollars if lodged in any Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>ROBERT DIXON.<BR>April 6, 1812.    56
