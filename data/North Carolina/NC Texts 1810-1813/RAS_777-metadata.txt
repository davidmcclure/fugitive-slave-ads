Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR> RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 8th of October last, in Bertie County, a likely negro fellow named WOODFORD. He is about 6 feet high, pretty black, thin visage, about 25 years of age, somewhat bowknee'd, very large feet, and long arms. I have no doubt, but that he is either in Edenton, or in the County of Chowan, where he has a father named Jim, living at Mrs. Horniblow's plantation; or that he is lurking about Hill's ferry, where he has a mother, and where he formerly attended as a ferryman. I will given the above reward to any person who will deliver said fellow to me, or confine him in any goal so that I get him again, together with all reasonable expences. <BR> Thomas Holley. <BR> Bertie County, Dec. 31, 1810.  4t 258
