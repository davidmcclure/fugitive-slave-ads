Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 30th of March, a Negro man by the name of HARDY, about 18 or 19 years old, stout made and well grown for his age, speaks slow, and is of the common complexion of Negroes. Said Negroe's mother belongs to Mr. Jeptha Daniel, of Nash county, where I have no doubt he has gone. His connections belong to the Mr. Battles, near the Falls of Tar river, and not far distant from Mr. Daniel's. I will give a reasonable reward to any person who will bring said Negro to me, or secure him so that I may get him again.<BR>JAMES B. LEE<BR>Wake County, April 1, 1812.
