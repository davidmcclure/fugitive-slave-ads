Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN-AWAY from the Subscriber, (living in Stokes County, eight miles from Salem, and four from Shober's Tavern, now occupied by Thomas Adams) on the first instant, a Negro man named PRINCE, about five feet eleven inches high, twenty-one years of age, had on when he went away a white furred hat, a light mixed cotton coat, cotton shirt, white & striped overalls, and walks with a halt which is occasioned by his having had his right thigh broke, and is shorter that the other. I expect he will change his name of and pass for a free man, and probably may have obtained a pass of some person. From information he aims for Wilmington in this state. Any person who will apprehend said Negro and secure him in goal, so that I get him again, shall receive the above Reward; and if brought to me all other reasonable charges shall be paid.<BR>WILLIAM WALKER.<BR>September 10, 1810.
