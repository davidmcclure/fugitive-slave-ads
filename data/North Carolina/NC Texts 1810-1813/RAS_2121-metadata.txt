Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber the 4th of Oct. last, a Negro fellow by the name of SIMON, formerly the property of Mr. Toole, near Tarborough; he  is about 5 feet 8 inches high, stout made and of a dark copper colour--His clothing is principally of home spun. It is believed he is harboured about the plantation of Mr. Toole, in this county, or by his Negroes near Tarborough. It is probable he may attempt to pass for a free man, as I am told he can read and perhaps write-I will give the above reward of twenty dollars if delivered to me, or secured in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>D.W. DAVIS.<BR>Franklin County, Nov. 14, 1811.
