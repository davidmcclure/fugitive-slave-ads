Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the Subscriber on the 12th of November, 1810, a Negro fellow named JACK, he is of a middle size, about five feet five or six inches high, and about 30 years of age; he has a down look, speaks slow when spoken to, and the whites of his eyes are inclined to be red, has a surley look and is considerably knock-kneed. His dress, when he went away, consisted of a pair of mix pantaloons, a blue broad cloth waistcoat, and a short coat made of Negro cotton dyed brown, and a cotton shirt. The said fellow was formerly the property of Uriah Bass, of Wayne County. I expect he will endeavour to obtain a free pass of some villian, and as he has been legally outlawed, I will give the above sum to any person that will deliver him to me in Johnston county, or the sum of twenty-dollars if he is secured in any jail, so that I get him again.<BR>JOS. [Joseph] Boon, jr.<BR>Johnston County, Jan. 1, 1811.
