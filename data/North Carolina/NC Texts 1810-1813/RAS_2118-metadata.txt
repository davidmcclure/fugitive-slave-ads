Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber, on the 13th inst. two Negro Fellows, named LEWIS and BRITTAIN. Lewis is a tolerable large Negro, 30 or 25 years of age, has one of his foreteeth knocked out, and stands with his toes tuned in a little. Britain is a young and likely fellow, about 25 years old, of the common size, and has a bold look. I will give five dollars for each of the above named fellows if caught in the neighbourhood, and ten dollars for either if caught out of the County and delivered to me.<BR>WILLIAM SMITH.<BR>Wake county, near Roger's X Roads,}<BR>August 16, 1811.}
