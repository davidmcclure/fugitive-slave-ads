Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM the Subscriber on the 21st inst. a Negro man by the name of HARRY, about twenty or thirty years old, spare made, and very black. When he ran off he was very indifferently clothed. Said Negro I purchased of Mr. James Greggory, of Johnston county, he has since that lived at Chapel Hill, and in Raleigh. Mr. Greggory, I am informed, purchased him in Norfolk, Virginia--One of which places I think it is most probable he will endeavour to get to. I will give a reasonable reward to any person who will bring said Negro to me, or secure him so that I get him again.<BR>JAMES PUTNEY.<BR>Franklin County, 28th May, 1812.
