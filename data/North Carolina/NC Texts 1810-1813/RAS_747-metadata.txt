Transcript: 40 Dollars Reward. <BR> Runaway from the Subscriber on the 28th December last, a Negro Man by the name of JACK, about 28 years of old, a nail-cutter and blacksmith by trade. This fellow is stout made, very black, appears to walk as though he was lame in his ancles[sic], and went off without any provocation whatever. I will give Twenty-Dollars reward if delivered to me in Edenton, with reasonable charges, if taken within, or the above reward if taken without this State and lodged in any gaol so that I get him again. This fellow can read and write, and it is more than probable has forged for himself a free pass. His father and mother resides at a Mr. Whedbee's in Durant's-Neck; and it is likely he may be harboured in that neighborhood. I forwarn all persons from harboring or carrying off said fellow at their peril. <BR> Nathaniel C. Bissell. <BR> Edenton, Jan. 6, 1812.  tf 307
