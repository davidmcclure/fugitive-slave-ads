Transcript: RUNAWAY <BR>FROM the subscriber in April last, a Negro man by the name of JIM--when runaway, calls himself Jack. He is about five feet three or four inches high, about 30 years of age, a large countenance and small eyes; very much pock-pitten, much bumped on his back; one of his hips appears to be higher than the other, which occasions him to walk with his toes in, and a little lame; always says he belongs to a gentleman in Charleston, by the name of James Oliver. When runaway professes to be an excellent sailor, which I believe to be true. This I mention in order to give caution to the mariners. He broke jail in Washington in this state, in August last. Any person securing him in jail, so I may get him, shall be well paid for his trouble. <BR>SOLOMON COTTON. <BR>Warren county, March 2, 1812.   10-2t.
