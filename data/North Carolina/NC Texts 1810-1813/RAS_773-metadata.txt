Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR> Ranway from the subscriber-living in Bertie County, on Sunday the 8th inst. Four NEGROES, viz. Isaac, Jim, Glasgow, and Paus. <BR>  ISAAC is about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, slim made, thin visage, pretty black, is marked by his mother on one of his shoulders, and about 20 years of age. He was formerly the property of James Riddick of Hertford County. <BR> JIM is about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, very thick set, of a yellowish complexion, shows his teeth very much, and two of his under front teeth are a good way apart, and when suddenly accosted, stutters a little, and is about 20 years of age. He was formerly the property of Amos Rayner, and passed, I understand, some time past in Edenton for a free man. <BR> GLASGOW is about 5 feet 3 or 4 inches high, slim made, of a yellowish complexion, and two of his under front teeth also apart, but not so much as Jim's, and about 17 years of age. He was formerly the property of James Sowell, of Hertford County. <BR> PAUS is about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, very thick set, full face, and very black, and about 17 years of age.  They took away while myself and family were at meeting, several articles of my clothing; and were, the evening of the day they absconded, seen together. <BR> The above reward will be given to any person who will apprehend and deliver said Negroes to me, or secure them in any jail so that I get them. <BR> All masters of vessels and others are cautioned against employing or carrying them off at their peril. <BR> John Leary. <BR> September 10, 1811.
