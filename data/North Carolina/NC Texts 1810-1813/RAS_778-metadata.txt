Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR> WILL be given to any person who will deliver to me, in Chowan County, my negro woman ESTHER, formerly the property of Thomas Mathias, who ran away upwards of of a year ago. She is a tall stout wench, about 47 or 48 years of age, pretty black, and went off with, I am informed, one William Lowry, tobacconist, formerly of Edenton, who has had her upwards of 20 years for a wife. She had permission to go to Plymouth for some clothes left there, from whence she eloped with said Lowry to Washington town, where he, I am told by a Mrs. Young of that place, produced a bill of sale for said wench from me, which he, or some person for him, must have forged, as I never saw the man in my life. From Washington I understand he and his spouse moved to Wilmington, where they no doubt are. One half the above reward will be given to any person who will give me correct information, by letter or otherwise, where she may be had.--All persons whatever are hereby forwarned from purchasing said wench of the aforewarned Lowry, as he has no claim whatever to her, except that of keeping her as a wife. <BR> John M'Guire. <BR> December 3, 1811.  4w 201
