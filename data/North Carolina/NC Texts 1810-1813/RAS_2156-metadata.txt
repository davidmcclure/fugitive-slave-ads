Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>FROM me on the 30th day of August, a Negro man named WILLIS, 21 or 22 years of age; has lately been whipped; can look a man in the face and tell as smooth a lie as any one without exception. I will give Five Dollars reward for said Negro man, if delivered to me in Raleigh; and will also be much obliged to any person who may hereafter find him out my service without a pass, to give him 39 lashes, well laid on. Said man Willis is rather of a yellow complexion, very smart and active, five feet six or seven inches high.<BR>Wm. [William] Jones.<BR>Raleigh, September 17, 1812.
