Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR> RUNAWAY from the subscriber some time in the month of September last, a negro man by the name of ISAAC, formerly the property of Christopher L Lent, dec. He is about 25 years of age, very small, about 5 feet high, remarkably grum when spoken to, one of his legs has been broken, which  occasioned him to limp a little, but is scarcely perceivable, he is well known in and about Elizabeth City, and has a wife in that neighborhood, where he was not long since seen. The above reward will be paid to any person who will deliver to me the said negro in Hertford, or confine him in any jail so that I get him again. All masters of vessels and others are forwarned from harboring, employing or carrying him off, as I am determined to prosecute any such offender. <BR> James Wood, sen. <BR> Hertford, Feb. 8, 1811.
