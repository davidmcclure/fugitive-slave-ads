Transcript: 30 Dollars Reward. <BR> RUNAWAY from the subscriber about the 15th January last, negro man HARDY, a bright mulatto, about 22 years old, spare made, has a smile in countenance when spoken to, had on when he went away a mixed homespun suit of clothes, a brown surtout coat considerably worn, cuffs torn off,  pockets in the folds and sides, a pair of Suwarrow boots, with sundry other clothes, amongst which was a striped homespun coat and pantaloons. I expect he will endeavor to pass for a free man, and has, probably, obtained a free pass. The above reward will be given to any person if taken out of the State, Fifteen Dollars if out of the County, and Eight Dollars if taken in the County and delivered to me, or confined in jail so that I get him again. <BR> N.B. All masters of vessels and others are forwarned against taking or carrying said fellow out of the state under the penalty of the law. <BR> George Outlaw. <BR> Bertie County, Feb. 5, 1811.  2t 258
