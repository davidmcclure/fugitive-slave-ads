Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber about the 10th of last month, a bright mulatto man by the name of CHARLES; he is 23 years old, about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, thick and strong made and looks bold. Said mulatto has a remarkable mark on the ridge of his nose that looks like a small scar that has cured up and left something black in the wound-the mark is small but may be easily discovered on close examination. He will no doubt alter his name and endeavour to pass as a free man, as he is a remarkable bright mulatto and has very black hair and pretty straight. He will probably aim for the sea board, and endeavour to get on board some vessel.<BR>The above reward of $20 will be given to any person who will apprehend him put him in Jail, and give me information by letter directed to Smithfield, Johnston county, North Carolina.<BR>HENRY BELL.<BR>Johnston county, 10 miles north of Smithfield, October 18, 1812.}
