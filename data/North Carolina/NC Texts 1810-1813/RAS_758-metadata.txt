Transcript: 5 Dollars Reward. <BR> RUNAWAY from the subscriber on the 14th inst. a Negro Woman named LYDIA, about 45 years of age, pretty black, about 5 feet high and slim made. She had on when she ran off a white homespun habit made of cotton and tow. I expect she is lurking some where about Capt. Paine's plantation on Chowan river. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver her to me, or confine her in Edenton jail so that I get her again. If she comes in of her own accord she will be pardoned. <BR> Philip M'Guire, <BR> Chowan County, Oct. 17, 1812.
