Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>In September last, from no other cause but the consciousness of deserving punishment, a negro fellow FRANK, about 5 feet 8 inches, thirty years of age, ran-away from my Exeter plantation, four miles below Wilmington. He is slim, round faced, talks much, during which time he is generally smiling and shakes his head-understands sawing in a mill very well. Having an uncle at Fayetteville, named Maclin, belonging to Mr. M'Millian, it is said he has been harboured in the neighbourhood, and as he was Col. Read's waiting man, he might travel up the country, where he was acquainted, particularly about Hillsborough. A handsome reward will be given agreeably to the trouble, for lodging him in any Jail in the state, of delivering him at Belvedier, & the above reward on proof to conviction of his being harboured by any white person.<BR>BENJAMIN SMITH.<BR>Dec. 19, 1810.
