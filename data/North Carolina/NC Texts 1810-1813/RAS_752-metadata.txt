Transcript: 40 Dollars Reward.<BR> WILL be given to any person who will apprehend and deliver to me my negro man HARRY, who ranaway in August 1810, without any provocation whatever. He is about 5 feet 10 inches high, stout and well made, of a yellowish complexion; and when looking any person scarcely opens his eyes. He has a scar somewhere about his face, but I am not able to designate the place.--If said negro Harry should think proper to return home within the space of thirty days, he will not be chastisted for past offences; but should be taken and brought home, he will certainly receive such correction as his unwarrantable conduct deserves. I have reason to believe he is lurking somewhere about Edenton. All masters of vessels and others are particularly cautioned against harboring, employing, or carrying said fellow off, under the pentaly of the law. <BR> Frederick Creecy. <BR> Chowan County, Nov. 18, 1811. 3t 299
