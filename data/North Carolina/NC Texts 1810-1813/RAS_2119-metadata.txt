Transcript: STOP THE VILLIAN!!!<BR>RANAWAY from me on the 10th of August last, my Negro man BRISTER, who previous to his going killed one of my sons with hoe. Said Negro is 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, has a black complexion, stout made, a dull face, and a big dull voice--has a scar on one of his knees, occasioned by the cut of an axe, & a scar on his right thumb, caused by a whitlow.<BR>For the apprehension of one who has been guilty of such an offence it would almost seem unnecessary to offer a reward--Justice an the good of society require his apprehension and punishement. I will however give a liberal reward for him dead or alive.<BR>The said Negro has been heard of in the neighbourhood a few days past; but may possibly go off.<BR>CHRISTOPHER ROBERTSON.<BR>Wake County, Sept. 20, 1811.
