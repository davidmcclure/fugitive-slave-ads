Transcript: RANAWAY<BR>From the Subscriber on the 16th Instant,<BR>A BRIGHT MULATTO BOY, named JOHN about 18 years old, badly grown, he wore away a pair of negro cotton overalls and jacket, the latter dyed blue, but carried off with him some other cloathes, he speaks slow when spoken to, and has a bushy head of hair.  It is probable he may attempt to pass as a free boy, and may obtain a free pass from some villian or other.  I will give a handsome reward to any person who will deliver the said boy to me or secure him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>ISAAC HUNTER, Senior.<BR>Wake County, Feb. 25   97 tf
