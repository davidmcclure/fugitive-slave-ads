Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward. <BR> Run away from the Subscriber some time in July 1806, a negro man by the name of STEPHEN. <BR> He is a slim spare made fellow, thick bushy head of hair, remarkable small legs, rather of a yellowish complexion, and about 4 feet 9 or 10 inches high, the fore finger of his left hand is entirely stiff, occasioned by a bite in the joint when fighting. He is remarkably fond of fidling, and commonly has a fiddle hung to his back. He has a mother living in the County of Pasquotank by the name of Franky, commonly called Old Frank, belonging to Joseph Banks.--I have lately been informed that a fellow of that name and description has been seen working in the Shingle Swamp, and flatting shingles down in the Canal. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me in Hertford, or Twenty-Five Dollars, to secure him in any gaol in this State so that: I get him again. <BR> JOHN WOOD. <BR> Hertford, Perquimans County. <BR> Jan. 28, 1811.  3w 257
