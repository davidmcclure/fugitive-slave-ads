Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on Wednesday, the 7th instant, a likely young Negro fellow by the name of REUBEN, about 17 years of age and rather larger than unusal, weighing about 175 pounds; of a black complexion, and walks rather stopping. When he eloped he had on a Raccon hat, his other clothing not recolleted--he was purchased a few years past of Mr. Miles Cattling, Gates County, near the Virginia line, and it is more than probable that he may attempt to get again to his old neighborhood. If taken within the County the above reward will be given, but if taken out of this County, or secured in Jail so that I get him again I will give an additional reward of Ten Dollars more.<BR>JOHN SANDERS.<BR>Pitt County near Greensville, March 12, 1811.}
