Transcript: RUN-AWAY<BR> FROM the subscriber on the 13th inst. my Negro Man CUFFE. He is about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, very black, about 45 years of age, and has a scar on his forehead a little above his eye-brows, occasioned by the kick of a horse when young, his head is bald, and his right ear cropped, which he commonly keeps covered with an old handkerchief to prevent exposure. I will give a reward of 5 Dollars if taken within the County, 10 if taken without, and 20 if taken without the State and delivered to me. All masters of vessels and others are forbid harboring, employing or carrying said fellow off, under the penalty of the law. <BR> MARY FREEMAN. <BR> Bertie County, Nov. 21, 1811.  3w 301
