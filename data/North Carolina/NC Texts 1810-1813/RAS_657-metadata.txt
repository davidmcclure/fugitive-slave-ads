The other a black, 10 years old, 14 hands and a half high, blaze faced, blind of the near eye, and his off hind foot white.<BR>It is probable that he has a white woman with him, as one that he was too intimate with was seen with him 15 miles beyond Lincolnton.  She is very tall, has light hair, grey eyes, good complexion, and, for so  large a woman, may be called handsome.  The above reward will be given for said runaway and horses, by NICHOLAS GIBNEY.<BR>Mecklenburg County, N.C., Jan. 1.
