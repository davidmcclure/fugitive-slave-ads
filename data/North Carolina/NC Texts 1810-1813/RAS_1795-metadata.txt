Transcript: Stop the Runaway!<BR>RAN AWAY, from my Plantation near Hillsborough, on the 3d day of this month, a NEGRO MAN, named ANTHONY, the property of Gavin Alves.  He is five feet ten or eleven inches high, stout and well made, his complexion a little inclined to yellow, and about twenty-five years of age.  He had on when he went away a dark coloured short coat and white plantaloons, both of homespun kersey, but will probably change them, as he has a suit of homespun mixed cloth and a coat of dark coloured broad cloth, besides other cloaths.  It is probable he has gone to Raleigh, and will attempt to go to Wilmington by the way of Fayetteville.  I will give a generous reward to any person who will bring him to me, or have him confined in a Jail so that I get him, and will pay all reasonable expences.<BR>WM.[William] NORWOOD.<BR>Hillsborough, 4th January, 1811.    91
