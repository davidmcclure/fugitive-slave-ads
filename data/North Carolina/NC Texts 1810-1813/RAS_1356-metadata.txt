Transcript: TWELVE DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>STOP THE RUNAWAY!!<BR>ESCAPED from the Subscriber about the 15th of February last, a Negro man named SIMON, calls himself at times Simon Peter--He had for some time previous been runaway, was taken up and committed to Fayetteville Jail, where I had received him, and on my way home he made his escape at the house of a Mr. Ware in Montgomery county. He is about five feet ten inches high--about 40 years old--both ears cropped--commonly wears a cap to hide his ears--his clothing is uncertain, was very ragged when he went away. The above reward and all reasonable expences[sic] paid if delivered to me in Cabarrus County, near Concord, or if lodged in any Jail. As I have already been at considerable expence[sic] and trouble on account of said Negro, being myself lame, and him the only property of the kind I possess, it is hoped that all the well disposed will be as active in their exertions to apprehend said Runaway as if it was in my power to pay a much larger reward.--Peter was raised on Roan Oak, near the North Carolina line.<BR>PAUL KARRIKER.<BR>Cabarrus County, N.C. May 8, 1811.<BR>21--4t1dp.
