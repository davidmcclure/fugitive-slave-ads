Transcript: 250 dollars<BR>REWARD<BR>RAN-AWAY from the Subscriber's Platnation, on the night of the 28th instant, my Driver man JACK, who took with him his wife ANIC, LONDON, and his wife KESIAH, boy FLORESCO, and man ELIAS--six in number.--Jack is a stout, well made fellow, about 5 feet 11 inches high, and very black--his shoulders a little round; walks with his knees rather close, and has a scar on the top of one of his feet.  Anica, his wife, is a small black woman, neat in appearance, and has a mild voice.  London has a yellow complexion, is about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, and halts a little in his walk--His wife, Kesiah, is a stout, fine looking woman, very black--has a Wen on the back, and a small scar under one of her eyes.  Floresco, is the son of Kesiah, and is a fine looking boy, about 18 years of age, tall and slim, a long foot, and very black.  Man Elias, is about 5 feet 8 inches high, black complexion; he sometimes speaks rather thick; is stout made and has a wen under one of his ears, the size of a walnut.<BR>Their Winter Cloths[sic] which they took with them, are of White Plains.<BR>I will give a Reward of One Hundred Dollars for Jack--Fifty Dollars for Anica, and Twenty-five Dollars each for London, Kesiah, Floresco and Elias.<BR>These Negroes, no doubt, will visit Newbern, and it is likely will range about Trent, White Oak, New River, and up Neuse, as far as General Simpson's, as they have connexions at each of these places.  Anica and Elias have fathers in Newbern, and the fathers of Jack and Kesiah, are at Col. Edmund Hatch's, in Jones county.<BR>They have been the leaders on my Plantation, and I think it probable they will be resolute in their endeavors to avoid being taken.-- If, therefore, either of said slaves should be killed in an attempt to confine them.  I will not hold the person using such violence, liable for any penalty.  And, if said Negroes are not taken, or do not return home, they will, in a few days, be legally outlawed.<BR>Masters of vessels and others, are forbid harbouring or carrying away said slaves, under the penalty of the law.<BR>JOSIAH HOWARD.<BR>Jones county, Nov. [November] 30, 1821-193.
