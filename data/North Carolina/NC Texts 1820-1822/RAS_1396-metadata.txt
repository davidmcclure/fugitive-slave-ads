Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber at Blount Hall, in Pitt County, on the 30th of June last, a Negro Man named<BR>GILFORD.<BR>Had on when he left home, a green kirsey round jacket, a pair of grey sattinet pantaloons, and an old beaver hat.  He has a large scar on his head, I believe on the right side-- is about 22 or 23 years old, dark complexion, about six feet high, stout made, and has large flat feet-- has a wife at Mr. Edward Quin's in Washington, where he was last seen, and about which place I suspect he is lurking, as he is well known in that neighborhood.<BR>The above reward will be paid to any person or persons that will deliver said negro or confine him in any jail so that I get him again, and all reasonable expenses paid.<BR>Said fellow is legally outlawed.<BR>I hereby forwarn all persons from harboring or employing GILFORD, and particularly Masters of vessels from carrying him away, as I am determined to prosecute all offenders, without distinction.<BR>William L. Blount.<BR>July 7th, 1821--175tf.
