Transcript: RANAWAY,<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 24th inst. my boy JOHN; he is about 18 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches high, of yellow complexion, wore off a white fur hat, cloathing not recollected. He has been in my service for several years, and almost every person that has visited Raleigh in the course of the time no doubt has a recollection of him, a further description is therefore deemed unnecessary.--Should any person see or hear of said boy they will confer a favor by informing me of the same by mail or otherwise. I will give a reward of 10 dollars for the apprehension and delivery of him to me in Raleigh, or 5 dollars if confined in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>JOSIAH DILLIARD.<BR>July 26, 1821.<BR>30 3t
