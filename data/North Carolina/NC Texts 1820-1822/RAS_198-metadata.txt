Transcript: $20 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from me about the 4th of February last, a negro man, by the name of Emsly, about 25 or 26 years of age, well grown, of a common  height, tolerable slim made, rather of yellow complexion, a very smooth skin; one of his eyes is out--I rather think it is his right. I do not recollect any other mark. I expect he is in or about Raleigh, as he has several acquaintances and relations in town. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me in Johnston county, 22 miles from Raleigh, on Little River, or confine him in jail so that I get him again--or 25 dollars for him dead. Any information can be obtained from Wm.[William] C. Tucker, in Raleigh, about the boy, as he is acquainted with him.<BR>BRYANT RICHARDSON.<BR>Johnston county, March 29.<BR>13-6tp
