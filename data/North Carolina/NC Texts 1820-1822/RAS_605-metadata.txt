Transcript: TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS<BR>REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 16th of January last, a negro man by the name of TOM, (since going away calls himself Jerry Gaskin.) He left here with a white sailor by the name of Brown. He is 33 years of age, tolerable black, about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, very talkative and insinuating to strangers, and very impudent; has three scars on his face besides one on the end of his nose; he is a blacksmith by trade, and a very noted fidler. I will give the above reward to any person that will lodge him in jail, so that I get him again. Masters of vessels, and other persons, are cautioned against harboring or carrying him out of the state, under the penalty of the law.<BR>THOMAS TROTTER.<BR>Washington, Beaufort county, N. C.<BR>March 3, 1821         5tp
