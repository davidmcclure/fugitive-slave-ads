Transcript: 200 Dollars Reward.<BR> RAN away from the subscribers, five Negro men, viz. Paris, Jacob, Charles, Moses and Cain. Paris left his owner the 10th of July last; he is full six feet high, yellow complexion, large white eyes, stutters a little when spoken to, about thirty years of age, has a scar over one of his eyes, an is a stout fellow. Jacob is about 45 or 50 years of age, middle size, gray headed, a pleasing countenance, stoops in his shoulders, has a black smooth skin, with a yellow cast, is a shoemaker and fidler, and can read and write. Charles is about 25 or 30 years of age, five feet 9 or 10 inches high, very black, stutters when spoken to, has a piece out of one side of his nose, is uncommonly fond of spirits, and when intoxicated is very forward and saucy, is remarkably well made and very straight. Moses is about 35 years of age, about five feet 8 inches high, yellow complexion, bushy head and whiskers, a scar on his upper lip, and a down look. Cain is about 40 years of age, very black, a likely fellow, when he smiles the gums inside are black, is a shoemaker, and can read. The four last named negroes left their owners about the 16th instant. All of them absconded without the least provocation; which induces us to think they will make their way to the North.  The above reward will be given, if taken out of the state-or $40 for either of them, if secured so that we get them again. It is fondly hoped that every good citizen will use his best endeavors to apprehend the above negroes, and thereby aid in suppressing one of the greatest evils that our land is threatened with. Letters on the subject directed to Daniel Gallent, White Hall post-office, Mecklenburg county, N.C. will duly attended to.<BR> WM.[WILLIAM] B. TAYLOR,<BR>JAMES DINKINS,<BR>DANIEL GALLENT,<BR>JAMES McKNIGHT, ALEX.[Alexander] GREER<BR> October 18, 1821.
