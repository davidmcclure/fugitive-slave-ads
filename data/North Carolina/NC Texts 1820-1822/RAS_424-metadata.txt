Transcript: 130 Dollars.<BR> Will be given for apprehending and delivering to the subscribers FOUR NEGRO MEN, (who left their owners on last evening for no other reason than to endeavour to reach some state where they will be free men,) viz: Robin, Jacob, Julius and Rixon (who perhaps may be in company with several others.) Robin is about 25 years of age, dark complexion, heavy built, a likely active waiting man,  and a good wagoner--an honest, faithful servant,  one who never had his back marked with a whip; in  word, we had all confidence in him. He has a large scar across one of his hands and fingers from the cut of a cotton machine. Jacob is a black fellow, about 45 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high, stoop'd shoulders, grey head and large whiskers: he is an old offender. Julius is about 35 or 40 years of age, yellow complexion, a little above the middle size, likely, active, smart fellow, can read and perhaps write. Rixon, belonging to James Harris, of York District, S.C. is about 35 years old, stout made, but lower than the common size of negroes; is of a black complexion, speaks slow, and has a down look when spoken to. He was brought from the eastern shore in Maryland, by Mr. Springs, 15 years ago, and sold to J. Harris. He took with him a drab great-coat, a suit of brown broad cloth, all new, two spotted vests, two pair white pantaloons, three pair of shoes, three neek[sic]-cloths, a white hat, and upwards of $20 in cash. No doubt they (with all in their company) will make the best of their way either on the route leading to the north or west, perhaps the latter. The above reward, or one quarter for either, will be paid on their being apprehended or secured, so that we get them. We expect their route will be by the way of Wilkesborough. Any communication respecting the above negroes, or either of them, can be made to Robert Dinkins, Charlotte, NC.<BR> JAMES DINKINS,<BR> FREDERICK DINKINS, <BR> JAMES HARRIS.<BR> Mecklenburg Co.
