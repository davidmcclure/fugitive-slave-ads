Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward<BR>SHALL be promptly paid to any person, who will take up and secure (so that I get him) my negro man Robbin, ran off on the 7th April last, without the least provocation, having never received a lick either from me or any one under me. Robbin is about 35 years of age, is likely and of just stature and proportion, he is somewhat Tawney and has a scar on his left eye-brow said to have been made by a whip, which causes the eye-lid to hang a little lower than the other. His back is smartly cut by former owners, he is brisk in his movements, is handy, very plausible and knows how to spay hogs. I purchased Robbin of John King of this county, about 12 months ago, who had him of one Russell of Johnston county. It is probable Robbin is now lurking his old range between Kings, Russell's and Mr. James Hinton's where he has a wife, or has gone lower down toward Newbern.<BR>JNO.[John] W. CHARLES.<BR>Wake County, June 25, 1821.<BR>26-tf.
