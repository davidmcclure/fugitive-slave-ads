Transcript: $40 Reward.<BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, near Charlotte, on Sunday night, the 28th inst. FOUR NEGROES, viz: Tom, Tone, Tob, and Washington. Tom is about 55 years of age, modest and cute. Tone is about 15 years old, dark colored, and out mouthed. Tob is not quite so dark, but thick made, and appears stubborn. Washington is about 10 years old, and down-cast look. Tom took with him a pair of buck-skin trowsers[sic], and a drab great-coat. The boys had one mixed coat, and one of red and blue homespun; two pair of news shoes, two new wool hats, and two or three pairs of other shoes. They also took with them one rifle gun, without a box, and a half stocked shot gun, and a screw-driver, with a buck-horn handle. To any person that will apprehend the above negroes and lodge them in any jail so that I get them again, I will pay Forty Dollars; or twenty dollars for Tom alone, and ten dollars for Tone, and five dollars for each of the boys.<BR>ZENAS ALEXANDER.<BR>Mecklenburg Co.
