He took with him a surtout coat of grey cloth, blue pantaloons of cloth and of velvet, a suit of mixed homespun, the coat cut with plain busts, also a suit of striped homespun dyed with copperas, coat cut double breasted, a white had, and probably other clothing.?� Welcome is about 34 years of age, is stout and well set, legs a little bowed, full face, large thick neck, a man of great strength, has large thick and flat feet, walks rather slow and heavy, his counteance somewhat heavy, speaks easy and with some address, and generally not in a high tone, is a negro of fine understanding, can read and write a little has some knowledge of figures, has no appearance of hard usage, much inclined to be fleshy, would weigh about 180, and supposed to be about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high.<BR>Welcome took with?� him his daughter BETSEY, in her 13th year--she is well grown, compexion[complexion] very fair for a negro, stout features, a small dimple in her chin, looks growing and thrifty, was raised a house servant, when vexed sticks out her mouth and look impudent; took with her some homespun frocks, and a calico one blue with white spots and a tippet of the same.?� Betsey had a good pair of leather shoes, and Welcome had a pair with high quarters.<BR>I was abset for 8 days; Welcome was entrusted with the farm and stock.?� He took his daughter in the day time from the possession of their mistress.<BR>Welcome, I think, was raised in Pasquotank; he will probably attempt to pass both himself and daughter as free persons; he may a forged pass, and will likely make for some seaport.
