Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber, living 12 miles south of Raleigh, a Negro Man by the name of HARDY (belonging to the estate of Joseph Tucker, de'd.[deceased])  He is about 30 years of age, dark complected, about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high; had on when he went off an old white fur hat, a blue shambray coat with a short homespun one over it, with pantaloons of tow and cotton. I suspect he will be lurking about Raleigh or its vicinity.  I hereby forwarn all persons from harboring said negro, as the law will be put in force against them.  Any information respecting him will be thankfully received; and all reasonable expences paid for delivering him to me or confining him in jail.<BR>THOMAS G. WHITAKER.<BR>February 11, 1822.    69tf
