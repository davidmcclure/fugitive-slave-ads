Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living on the Town Creek, Edgecombe county, a Negro Man by the name of JACK. He is a common mulatto, about 40 years of age, 5 feet 5 inches high, has a small scar across his nose, and one of his ancles[sic] is larger than the other, occasioned by a sprain.  Jack absconded about the 6th of February last; since that time his Wife and two Children have gone, and I have no doubt but they are lurking in Fayetteville, Newbern, or Washington, amongst the free negroes.  Whoever will apprehend said Negro and deliver him to the subscriber, or lodge him in jail so that I get him, shall receive the above reward.<BR>THOMAS GILL.<BR>April 18.    89 6w
