Transcript: 20 Dollars Reward. <BR>WENT away, on the night of the 28th ult. from the subscriber, near Charlotte, Mecklenburg county, N.C.  a negro man by the name of PEYTON-of a dark complexion, rather spare made, about six feet high, thirty-three or fours years of age; when spoken to he speaks quick and rather abruptly; I believe he is defective in one of his arms, so that he cannot easily raise it above his head. He had on when he left me a very good great coat of drab colored flushing, a pretty good wool hat, a new and large pair of yellow colored cotton pantaloons, and some other indifferent clothing, but no close bodied coat. It is probable he will make towards Richmond, Va. where I purchased him last fall. I will give the above reward to any person who will apprehend and secure the said fellow and give information so that I get him again.<BR>BENJAMIN JOHNSON.<BR>[illegible] April 2, [illegible]
