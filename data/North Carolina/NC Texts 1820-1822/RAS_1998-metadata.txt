Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward<BR>WILL be given for apprehending and delivering to me, or confining in jail so that I get him again, my Negro Fellow<BR>TOM,<BR>who ran away about the 1st of October last, without any provocation. He is about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches, high yellowish complexion, stout built, and about 30 years of age, cross-ey'd [sic], and has a small piece off one of his ears, occasioned by fighting. He has a father in Chowan county belonging to Thomas Brownrigg, where it is probable he may be lurking; or is endeavoring to get to the North where he has an idea of being free. Masters of vessels and others are strictly forbidden from harboring, employing, or carrying him off at their peril, as the law will be strenuously enforced against those who may offend: particularly that of carrying him off, as the penalty in this case is Death without benefit of clergy.<BR>Bertie County, Dec. 12, 1820<BR>The editors of the Norfolk Beacon are requested to give this three insertions, and forward their account to me at Colerian Post Office, Bertie whom it will be paid.<BR>J.F.
