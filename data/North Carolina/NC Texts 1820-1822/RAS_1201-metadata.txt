Transcript: NOTICE. <BR> RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 9th of this instant, a negro man named JOE, and his wife named SINA, and two female children, one of the children four, the other two years old. Joe, the negro man, is twenty-five or six years old, five feet right or nine inches high, stout build, very black, and uncommonly large feet; had on when he left me, a coarse blue broad cloth coat, and a black wool hat. His wife Sina is twenty-eight or thirty years old, middle size, has large eyes, high cheek bones, spare face, her dress not recollected. It is thought that a negro girl named Silvia, the property of J. Purvines, my neighbour, who was missing on the same day that my negroes left me, is in company with them. Said Silvia is fourteen or fifteen years old, well grown of her age, dress not known. Any person who will apprehend said negroes, and lodge them in any Jail, so that I can get them, or deliver them to me, shall be rewarded for his trouble, with all reasonable expences paid.<BR>JOHN GRIER.<BR> Mecklenburg County, N.C.<BR> Feb. 15, 1822. 7w90--2r
