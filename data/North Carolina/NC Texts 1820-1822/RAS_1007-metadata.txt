Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY on a Saturday night last, my negro boy GODFREY, apparently without cause: a dark mulatto, aged about twenty or twenty-one, badly grown, weight about one hundred and fifteen or twenty his foreteeth broad and inclined to project out, large pop eyes, a little bow legged, and somewhat stocky or well built.?� He was dressed in a plain black velvet pair of pantaloons, a striped worsted waistcoat, also a white one with black stripes, and a dark shaggy greatcoat, a black glazed hat with a small piece of the brim broken off; it is probable he may change his dress.<BR>I have reason to believe that he has been seduced from my service by a free boy named MIKE COSTA, alias MIKE MITCHELL, about the same size, a little taller, and of a lighter complexion, with straight black hair.?� The said Costa, alias Mitchell, has recently returned to this place from Philadelphia, by way of Petersburg or Norfolk if I am not misinformed, and has probably deluded my boy with an expectation of conducting him to the same place.<BR>The above reward will be given for his apprehension and delivery to me, if taken out of the limits of this State; or Twenty-Five Dollars in the State.<BR>JOHN BRANCH.<BR>Raleigh, October 17, 1820?�?�?� 100--<BR>P.S. Mitchell had obtained Certificates of his freedom a few days before he left this place, for the purpose, as he had stated, of going on to Newbern; which may be used by either, as emergency requires.<BR>The Editors of the Newbern Centinel are requested to give this advertisement three insertions.
