Transcript: $200 For Barlet & Ned.<BR>BARLET is a large black fellow, about thirty years old; I purchased him of Ephraim Bailey, of Granville, in the month of October 1818, and he escaped from me in Caswell county a few days afterwards. NED was purchased from Sterling Anderson, of Nash county, and escaped from Louisburg last April. It is supposed Barlet is lurking about the neighborhood of the Beaver Dams in Granville, or Louisburg in Franklin. Ned, I expect, is in Nash, near the Court-House, as I believe he is harbored by some white persons near that place. I will give the above reward for the above slaves, or one hundred dollars for either, delivered to me in Milton, Caswell county. I will also give fifty for information of Ned's being harboured, so as to convict the person so offending.<BR>J. W. CLAY.<BR>October 18<BR>42 6t.
