Transcript: Five Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber on the 4th inst. a mulatto boy named HARRY, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, very likely, no mark recollected.  When he left me he had on a roundabout coat and pantaloons of homespun; a pair of shoes nearly new and a black home-made wool hat.  He has a down look when spoken to, and stoops forward when walking fast; his feet are very long.  The above reward will be given, provided he is caught in Orange county and confined in Hillsborough jail.<BR>Henry Neal.<BR>May 7.  17--3w
