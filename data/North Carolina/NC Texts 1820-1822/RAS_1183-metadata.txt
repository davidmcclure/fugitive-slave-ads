Transcript: NOTICE.<BR>RANAWAY from the City of Raleigh, on or about the 1st day of January, 1821, a Negro Man by the name of BEN, (Son of Robin, a Preacher, well known about Raleigh) about 27 years of age, common size, of black complexion, and bends back very much in his hams when standing; and I believe he was some lumps on his breast as large as peas, and has a very slim foot.? Ben has lived in Raleigh about five years.? He can read and write; and I expect he has a free pass from some person or other, and that he will aim probably for some free State.? Ben left Raleigh on the same day with the Proprietors of the Wax Figures which were lately exhibited there.? This is to forwarn all persons from harboring or hiring said Negro, or trading for him, on pain of being prosecuted as the law directs.<BR>Ten Dollars reward will be given to any person who shall secure said Negro in any Jail, and give notice thereof to the subscriber.<BR>WM.[WILLIAM] F. SMITH.<BR>Wake County, Jan. 24, 1821??? 14--3t
