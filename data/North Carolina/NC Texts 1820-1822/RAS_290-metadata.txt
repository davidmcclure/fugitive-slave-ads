Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber living in Person county, N.C. on the 9th inst. a bright mulatto fellow by the name of SAM, (sometimes calls himself Sam Overton) about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, slender built, about 21 years of age, light colored hair, pale complexion, large eyelids which appear to be swelled and hang very full over his eyes; he is very active, jumps well, runs fast, and can play a little on the fife and flute; took with him a flute which was not his own; wore away a light mixed coat and pantaloons of homespun, white waistcoat and black hat-- He was raised by me from a child in Person county, and I learnt him the Hatter's trade, and he can make a very good fur or wool hat.  I have no doubt but he will attempt to pass as a freeman and work at his trade.  Any information respecting him will be thankfully received, and the above reward given for his delivery to me or being confined in any jail in the United States so that I get him.<BR>S. COCHRAN.<BR>Person county, Dec. 21    64tt
