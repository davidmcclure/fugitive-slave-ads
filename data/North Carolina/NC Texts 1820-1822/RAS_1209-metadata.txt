Transcript: NOTICE.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber some time in February, 1820, my Negro Man CURRY, of middle size, about 26 or 27 years old, complexion dark, has eyes rather inclined to red, with a dark red speck in one of them, one of his under foreteeth gone next to an eye tooth.  Curry was taken up some time in September or October last in Granville county, and committed to Jail; he had been passsing six months before in the county as a free man under the name of Charles Barnet.  I had him taken out on the 13th of November, started home with him and got as far as Andrews's[sic] tavern, in Warren county, where he made his escape by jumping out of the window up stairs where he was confined.  I think he will endeavor to pass as a free man again.  I will give a reward of Thirty Dollars to any one that will bring him to me 10 miles east of Warrenton, or Ten to secure him in any Jail so that I get him again.<BR>JOHN HARWELL.<BR>July 19.    39 7t
