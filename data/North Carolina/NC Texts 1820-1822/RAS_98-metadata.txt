Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>FROM the plantation of the subscriber near Louisburg, a Negro Man named PHILL, he is about five feet high, twenty five years old, has a large mouth, very thick lips, dressed in home made cloth and wears his hair platted before--he has been seen this week in Warrenton, and I expect he will continue in and about that place.  I will give a reasonable reward to any person that will take him and bring him to be or secure him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>ROBT.[Robert] FREEMAN.<BR>Franklin county, March 3.    20 1m
