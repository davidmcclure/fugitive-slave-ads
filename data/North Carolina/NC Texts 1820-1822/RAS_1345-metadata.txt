Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUNAWAY from the Plantation of Dr. Ezekiel Hall, about two years ago--his negro man WALLIE, a likely fellow, about 35 years of age, about 5 feet 10 inches high, has a black skin--and smooth face, with little or no beard, and has lost all his front teeth of his upper jaw. He has frequently been seen, in the neighborhood of Long Creek, and on the Sound, near John Hulits, where he has some relations. He may no doubt be readily apprehended at either of those places. The above reward will be paid to any one, who will deliver him to me, at the jail in Wilmington.<BR>SAMUEL HALL.<BR>August 4       tf
