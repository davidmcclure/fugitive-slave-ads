Transcript: One Hundred Dollars<BR>REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 23d ult. while on a visit at the Shocco Spring, a Mulatto Man, named<BR>ALFRED,<BR>(calls himself Alfred Williams) He is about 26 years of age, five feet, five or six inches high; has a large mouth, with a hairy mole on the upper lip, at one corner of the mouth; a sulky look and a slow, lazy walk.  He took with him a variety of clothes--among which were, a blue cloth coat, blue surtout, blue ginghams short jacket, yellow striped homespun pantaloons, a fur hat, with coarse oil cloth cover, and a brown great coat--also, a well finished Pistol, 10 1-2 inch iron barrel, eight square, and smooth bore.-- He can read and write, and sing Psalms, &c. by note, and pretends to be very religious.  I will give the above reward for his delivery to me in Newbern, if taken out of the State; fifty dollars if apprehended within the State, and delivered to me; fifty dollars if taken up and confined in any jail out of the State, so that I get him, or twenty-five dollars if apprehended and secured in any jail within the State.  All persons, and masters of vessels particularly, are forwarned from harbouring or employing him, under the penalty of the law.<BR>Edward Pasteur.<BR>Newbern, October 6th, 1821--185tf
