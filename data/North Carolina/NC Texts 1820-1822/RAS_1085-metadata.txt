Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS<BR>REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber on the 16th inst. a Negro Man named LONDON POLLOCK, about five feet six or seven inches high, of a complexion between yellow and black, and an  uncommonly intelligent and likely boy, about 23 years of age; he has been for several years of a house servant and is very fond of dress.  He worse a blue broad cloth coat with velvet collar, which had been a long coat but the skirts lately taken off, and striped pantaloons; is believed he also carried with him a black long coat.  He also took with him one of my horses, a bright bay, black mane, legs, and short switch tail, a raw boned, gaunthorse, even when in good order, a very fast traveller, and has a remarkable scar on one of his feet, between the setlock joint and hoof, done by entangling himself with a rope: also a saddle and bridle with plated mountings.  It is supposed that he is making him way to the North, probably by the way of Petersburg.<BR>The above reward will be given for his apprehension and confinement in any place so that I get him, and exdenses[sic] paid, if delivered to me--and a suitable reward for the horse if returned alone.<BR>JOHN P. DAVES.<BR>Newbern, May 25th.--'18tf.
