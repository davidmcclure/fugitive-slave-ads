Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from me a Negro Man named LEWIS; about 22 years old, well built, of a bright copper color, has a scar on the temple near one of his eyes occasioned by a burn when small, and is hard of hearing.  He took with him considerable clothing, the upper ones mostly mixed homespun with a black sleep hat and black crape around the crown.  I have reason to believe he has directed his course to the North for the purpose of obtaining his freedom, and it is quite probable has obtained a free pass.<BR>Any person securing said Negro in any Jail out of this State, so that I get him again, shall be entitled to the above reward; and taken in this State, so that I get him again, shall be entitled to Ten Dollars.<BR>A. SPIVEY.<BR>Windsor, Bertie county, N.C.}<BR>Oct. 8, 1821} 53 5t<BR>The Editors of the Norfolk Herald will please insert the above for three weeks and forward their account to A.S.
