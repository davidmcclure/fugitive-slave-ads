He is well known in Newbern, and has a father and mother living at Fort Barnwell, owned by Mr. Luke Russell, where I think he will go previous to his making any further attempt to escape.  I expect he will endeavor to get on to some of the northern sea-ports, and pass for a free man.  All owners and masters of vessels are forwarned from employing or carrying away said fellow under the strictest penalty of the law.<BR>If said LODRICK is apprehended and secured within this State, so that I get him, I will pay a reward of Fifty Dollars, and if taken out of the State and secured so that I get him.  I will pay One Hundred Dollars to the person so apprehending said fellow and forwarding me information that will lead to his recovery.<BR>JAMES R.
