Transcript: Stop a Runaway Negro!<BR> RAN away from the subscriber, living near Statesville, Iredell County, N.C. a heavy, well made, and very black NEGRO BOY named Lunnon. He is apparently about 25 years old, is very fond of dress, very foppish, and assumes an air of importance among other negroes, but when spoken to by a white man, affects a great deal of politeness; he generally wears long whiskers. He was formerly the property of James Ramsay, Esq.[Esquire] of Rowan County, N.C. from whom he ran away, and was absent nearly three years, during which time he was in the Forks of Yadkin, and passed under the assumed named of free Klick Graham. Is is probable he will make for the state of Ohio, as he once before attempted to get there. Any person lodging said negro in any jail, or giving me information so that I get him, shall be liberally rewarded.<BR>ANDW.[Andrew] N. Allison[?]<BR>Sept. 1, 1821. 66
