Transcript: Twenty-five Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, at his residence in Randolph county, N.C. on the 8th instant, Two young Negro Men, viz. JESSE and ELIJAH.  Jesse is about twenty-two years old, weighs about 140 pounds, of low status, but well made, is of dark mulatto color, and can read print tolerably well.  Elijah is about eighteen years old, spare made, rather inclined to be slender built, and his lips project something beyond the proper length.--He had on when he left, a half-worn chip hat and thin homespun apparel.  Both are intelligent, smart fellows, and will, no doubt, try to pass as free men, under the sir-name of Walden, Evans, or Chandler.  They are partly Indian blood.<BR>The above reward will be given for the apprehension and confinement of said Negroes in any Jail so that I get them again, or Twelve Dollars and Fifty Cents for either.<BR>JNO.[JOHN] K. ARMISTEAD.<BR>April 8, 1833    24 6w
