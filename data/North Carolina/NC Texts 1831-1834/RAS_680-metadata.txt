Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY, sometime in the month of May last, (while in the service of Col. Thomas Ousby,) a negro man by the name of William, belonging to the orphans of James Carstaphen deceased. He is about 21 or 22 years old, of common statu[r]e, yellow complexion, long bushy hair, his upper teeth a little decayed, and has a down look when spoken to. No other particular marks recollected. I have been informed that he was seen in the town of Halifax on Monday of the Christmas hollidays[sic], in company with another runaway negro; and it is supposed that he is now lurking in the neighborhood of the town of Halifax or somewhere in the county. His mother, (belonging to the same estate,) lives at Mr. Benj.[Benjamin] Spruill's, in Scotland Neck, (who owns her husband,) where he may sometimes visit. He has other relations near the town of Halifax.<BR>The above reward will be given for the apprehension and delivery of said negro, to me, or for his confinement in jail so that I get him again. All masters or owners of vessels, and others, are hereby cautioned against harboring or employing the said negro, as the law will be rigidly enforced against all such offenders.<BR> RICE B. PIERCE, Guardian.<BR>Halifax, N. C. Jan. 14, 1832.<BR>46--tf
