Transcript: 25 DOLLARS<BR>REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber on the night of the 3rd inst. Two Negro Boys by the name of<BR>JIM & SOLOMON.<BR>Jim is a large stout fellow, about 35 years of age, dark complected, his head is little grey; he had on when he runaway a pair of black princetta pantaloons, a blue round about coat and white fur hat, pretty much worn. Solomon is rather light complected and rather smaller than Jim, about 25 years of age; he wore away a pair of brown linsey pantaloons, white linsey coat and a black fur hat with crape on it. The above Negroes were purchased in Maryland a few weeks ago, and I have no doubt are trying to get back.
