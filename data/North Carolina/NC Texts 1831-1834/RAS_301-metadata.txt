Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR>RAN OFF from my plantation on Toisnot, Edgecombe county, on the 19th inst. a negro man named<BR>BRYANT<BR>22 or 23 years old, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, stout built, quite yellow for the appearance of his hair which is as knotty as the negro's usually is, has long lips, large feet and long toes, has a down look when spoken to, had on when he went off dark clothes and a black furred hat. He will probably lurk about Dr. Hall's plantation near Tarborough, where his father and mother are, until he can procure free papers, to pass to a free State, as he has done the like before. I will give the above reward to any person who will confine him in some jail within this State so that I get him again, or deliver him to me in Stantonburg.<BR>WILLIE BROWNRIGG.<BR>April 24th, 1833.<BR>35
