Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, on the 6th instant, a negro man named DANIEL, about 33 years old, about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a black complexion, and when spoken to is apt to look down; his teeth is tolerably wide apart; he is a house carpenter by trade, and worked in Pittsborough, Chatham county, at the time he ran away.

Singleton drove a red wagon with three horses, two sorrels and a bay; he had in family the wife of Daniel and five black children; Singleton's wife had no children. A reward of twenty-five dollars will be given for his apprehension and confinement in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>HENRY BROWN, Agent<BR>for Alfred Alston.<BR>Fish Dam, Wake Co.}<BR>Nov. 22, 1831}<BR>48 3m
