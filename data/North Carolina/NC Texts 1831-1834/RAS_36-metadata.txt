Transcript: $10 REWARD.<BR> RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 28th day of December last, my man Charles about twenty years of age, height not known, rather slender made, has large full eyes, stutters considerably.

Any person taking up said fellow and delivering him to me, eight miles West of Salisbury, shall receive the above reward. <BR> WILLIAM GAY. <BR> February the 8th, 1832.
