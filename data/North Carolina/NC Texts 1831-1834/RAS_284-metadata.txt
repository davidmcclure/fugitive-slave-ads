Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>MY negro man WILEY left my home and service, on the 22d March last, without provocation, and with a purpose, I presume, of getting off to the North. He is of moderate size, about five feet four inches high, and would pass for a bright mulatto, having long woolly hair, and blue eyes. I expect he is about Washington, Wilmington or Newbern, attempting to get away--for it has been frequently a theme of conversation with him, when he has named these places. Masters of vessels and men passing on the waters, are particularly cautioned against receiving him. The above reward will be given for his apprehension and confinement in jail, or delivery to me.<BR>WM.[WILLIAM] P. BIDDLE.<BR>Craven County, 10th April, 1834. 94tf
