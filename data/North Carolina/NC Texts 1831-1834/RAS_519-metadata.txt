Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>The above reward of twenty-five dollars will be given to any person who will apprehend and confine my Negro Boy TOM in jail, so that I get him again. Said Tom ran away from me some time in August last. He is about 27 years of age, and five feet 2 or 3 inches high, dark complected, and free spoken. He had on when he left a blue cloth coat, and an old white wool hat, and other clothes not recollected. He has had three of his fingers on his right hand cut off. I purchased him from Mr. James Doren, who says he bought him of a Mr. Bishop in Halifax county, N. C. It is probable said Boy is lurking about there.<BR>WILLIAM P. CHAMBERS.<BR>Anson county, Dec. 21, 1832<BR>2 5w
