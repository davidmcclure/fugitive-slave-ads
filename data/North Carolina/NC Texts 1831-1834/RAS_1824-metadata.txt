Transcript: Take Notice!<BR> RAN AWAY, on the 20th of February, my Negro Man<BR> DERRY. He is about 35 or 36 years old--near 6 feet high, very black complected, --has high cheek bones, and large feet. He had on, when he left me, a linsey roundabout coat, copperas-colored over-alls, and an old wool hat. Any person who will return said negro to me, at my residence, at the mills formerly owned by Col. David Caldwell, in Iredell County, N.C. or confine him in any jail so that I get him, shall be amply compensated for all trouble and expense.<BR> S. GLASCOCK, Sen'r.<BR> March 29, 1834.   4t
