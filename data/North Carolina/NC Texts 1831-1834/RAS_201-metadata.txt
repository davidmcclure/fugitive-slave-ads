Transcript: $20 REWARD. <BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 28th May last, my boy CRAWFORD, about 18 years of age, 5 feet 3 or 4 inches high, swarthy complexion nearly white, broad face and down look, no beard, straight hair not very black, very full breast--took with him a suit of new white cotton clothes and black fur hat.

A reward of Ten Dollars will be given, if taken within this county, to any person who will deliver said boy to the Subscriber, residing eight and half miles from Tarborough, on the Raleigh road, near Cokey bridge; or, if taken out of the county, Twenty Dollars will be given for his delivery to me: or if secured in any jail so that I get him again. All persons are hereby forbid harboring, employing, or carrying off said boy, under penalty of the law. <BR>SAMUEL P. JENKINS.<BR>Dec.[December] 17th, 1832.
