Transcript: $100 REWARD. <BR>THE subscribers will give the above reward for the apprehension of their absconding slaves, PETER and SAM, or Fifty dollars for either of them. They are supposed to be lurking about either Slocumb's, Clubfoots, or Coates' Creek; and are so well known at all of those places as to render a description of their persons unnecessary. They possibly may have gone to Duplin County at the instigation of a certain Isaac Lanier, who pretends to have a claim to them. <BR>BENJAMIN HARDESTY, <BR>BENJAMIN BORDEN, Jr. <BR>May 31, 1833.
