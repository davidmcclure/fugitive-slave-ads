Transcript: $100 Reward!<BR>ABSCONDED from on board the Steamer John Walker, belonging to Doyle O'Hanlon, of Wilmington, No. Ca., about the beginning of May last, my negro man BILL, he is about five feet 8 or 9 inches high, spare though well made, of a yellow complexion, his mother having been a mulatto, he is an artful, sensible fellow, and likely, but appears simple and good natured, very slovenly and dirty in his clothing, he has thick lips with full face and apt to smile when spoken to; he is about 20 or 21 years of age. It is probable he may have forged papers, and will try to get to Pennsylvania or New York. I have reason to believe that he has been aided or enticed away, and will pay the above reward for the apprehension of the fellow, and the conviction of any person who may be proved guilty or harboring or inducing him to run away; or I will pay Fifty Dollars to any person who will deliver the fellow to me at this place, or Twenty Five Dollars for lodging him in any Jail so that I get him again. He is said to have stolen several articles of clothing belonging to hands that were in the same employ.<BR>MARY McNEILL.<BR>Fayetteville, N.C. August 12, 1833--33 3t.
