Transcript: $25 Reward.<BR>Eloped from my plantation on Tosnot, Edgecomb county, on the 19th instant, a negro man named BRYANT, 22 or 23 years old, five feet 9 or 10 inches high, stout built, quite yellow for the appearance of his hair, which is as knotty as the negroes usually is, long lips, large feet and long toes, has a down look when spoken to; had on when he went off dark clothes and a black furred hat. It is probable that he will procure papers and attempt to pass for a free man, as he has done the like before, and will probably skulk about Doct. Hall's[?] plantation near Tarborough until he is prepared to make his escape, as his father and mother live there. I will give the above reward to my person who will confine him in jail so that I get him again, or deliver him to me at Stantonsburg.<BR>WILLIE BROWNRIGG.<BR>Stantonsburg, April 22, 1333[1833]<BR>19 tf
