Transcript: $50 REWARD! $50 MORE!!<BR>RANAWAY from the subscribers at Leaksville, Rockingham county, N.C. 5th May 1832, negro Dick, a blacksmith, aged forty three years; complexion quite yellow; mouth wide; full lips; and toe off--perhaps the big toe on the right foot (but not certain.) <BR>He belonged to the late John Thompson of Guilford; made two attempts to escape in his former owners's lifetime: Once he got near two hundred miles towards Ohio, and the next time to Wilmington, in this State. It is believed he will endeavour to reach a free State to the West, or to get on board some vessel in our Atlantic coast, at Newbern or Wilmington.<BR>We will give the above reward if arrested out of this State and returned to us, or twenty-five dollars if lodged in any jail so that we get him--except he be caught in Guilford or Rockingham; --if caught in either country we will give fifteen dollars.<BR>It is believed Henson, another blacksmith, nearly black, likely and lively, aged about thirty two years, who lately ranaway from T.L. Cowan of Salisbury, and who likewise did belong to said Thompson, is in company with said Dick.<BR>We have no doubt Mr. Cowan, (who is now to the North,) will give a similar reward for the apprehension of said Henson. No doubt they will endeavour to pass for free persons. Direct information to us at Leaksville or Greensborough.<BR>BARNET & MOREHEAD.<BR>May 15th, 1832.--kt. '97.
