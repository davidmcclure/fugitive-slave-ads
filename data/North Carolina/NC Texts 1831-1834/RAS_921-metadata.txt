Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, (living 21 miles from Raleigh, on the Tarborough road,) on the 29th of June last, my Negro man Fagan, 28 or 30 years old, dark complected, about 5 feet high; he has a bad set of teeth, a flat head[?] and a long face, and a scar on his right thigh just above the knee caused by a cut; crooked feet, the left one rather more than the other. He is quite active and artful; and I expect has got in with some base white man to take him out of the State. I will give a reward of ten dollars to any person that will take him up and deliver him to me or confine him in jail so that I get him again, or twenty dollars if taken and secured out of the State.<BR>BENNETT BURNE.<BR>July 8[?], 1834<BR>29 4w
