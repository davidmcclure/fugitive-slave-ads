Transcript: THIRTY DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 5th of February last, a Negro man named DANIEL. Said Negro is about thirty-five years old, five feet eight or ten inches high, of a dark yellow complexion, well proportioned and of a pleasing countenance. He is probably lurking about the town of Newbern with the intention of going on board of a vessel.
