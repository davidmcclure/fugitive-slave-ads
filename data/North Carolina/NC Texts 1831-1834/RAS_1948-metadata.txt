Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>Ran away from the subscriber, on the 16th instant, a negro man named TOM, very likely, about 35 years of age, dark complection[sic], and has a large scar under one of his eyes and on one of his legs, and goes genteelly dressed, and wears a watch when he thinks proper. He carried with him his wife, a bright mulatto girl, about 26 years of age. Said girl is the property of Isham Boise, dec'd[deceased], which I hired some months ago. Said girl is very quick spoken, and very active in her walk. It is probable that they will procure papers and pass for free people of color, and will try to get to some free State. I will give the above reward to any person or persons who will confine them in any jail, so that I get them again, or delivered to me at my plantation, 4 miles west of Louisburg, Franklin county, N. Carolina.<BR>JAMES HESTER.<BR>June 19, 1833<BR>27 3t
