Transcript: $10 REWARD<BR>FOR ELAN.<BR>RANAWAY, on the 28th ultimo, from my plantation on Stone House Creek, about three miles South of Mr. William Eaton's Ferry, negro ELAN, formerly the property of Doct. John T. Clanton, of Halifax county, N. C. He is about 5 feet 10 inches high, no particular marks recollected, and is between 19 and 21 years of age. I purchased him at public sale, in the town of Halifax, at last November Court, and have no doubt he is lurking about Dr. Clanton's plantation or neighborhood.--I will give the above reward, if delivered to my overseer at the above mentioned plantation or at my plantation Reedy Creek; or five dollars if lodged in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>PETER MITCHELL.<BR>Warrenton June 11.<BR>16--tf
