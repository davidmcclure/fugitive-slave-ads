Transcript: $20 REWARD.<BR>RUN AWAY from Mrs. George, on the night of the 13th inst. a bright mulatto girl by the name of<BR>SILLER,<BR>Belonging to the heirs of Jarret Watkins, dec'd. She is stout built and very likely--no other mark recollected. It is supposed that she has been enticed off by a free man, a bright mulatto, by the name of REDDICK MANLY, who I have no doubt has obtained free papers for her, and that they intend making their escape to Norfolk, from thence to the north. All persons are forbid harboring, and all owners or captains of vessels are forewarned from carrying said girl off under the penalty of the law. The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver the said girl to me in Tarborough, N.C. or secure her in some jail so that I get her again.<BR>HENRY JOHNSTON, Guardian.<BR>Tarborough, Sept. 28, 1832.<BR>6
