Transcript: $20 Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, about four weeks ago, a mulatto fellow by the name of<BR>MILES,<BR>He is tolerable well built, full round face, when interrogated generally frowns and looks down--his father belongs to Major Whitmel K. Bullock, and he some relations at Charles Wikinson, Esq's. He is about 21 or 22 years old. It is probable he may attempt to pass as a free fellow, being quite intelligent. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me, or secure him in jail so that I can get him again, and pay all reasonable expences[sic].<BR>W.D.
