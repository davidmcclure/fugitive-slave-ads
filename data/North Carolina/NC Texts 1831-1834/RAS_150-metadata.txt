Transcript: $100 REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on the 19th of October last, a negro man named TONEY, five feet 8 or 10 inches high, about thirty years old, close made, of a black complexion, low forehead, and smooth skin. He carried off clothes of different descriptions, and can dress decently if he will. He was sent to Mr. Gildersleeve's with a note, on business, & it is understood that he took up the idea that he was going to be sold or sent away, which was not so. Toney is well known in Craven County as a first rate hewer and timber-getter, and he can do pretty good work in a ship-yard. He was raised on Bay River, and formerly belonged to Elijah Cratch, Esq., decd[deceased]. He has relations and friends in Carteret, and is probably lurking about Beaufort or the Straits.<BR>ALSO, $25 REWARD<BR>For NELLY, a light mulatto woman, of common stature, cross look, and about 28 years of age, who ran away on the 2d of January.--Nelly took away with her her son, named JIM, 8 years old, but small of his age: his complexion is still lighter than that of his mother, and his hair is straight. The woman was raised on Adam's Creek, and has a sister living on Lower Broad Creek, and may be at some of those places, but it is believed that she is in Newbern or its vicinity.<BR>The above rewards will be given for the delivery of said negroes to the subscriber in Washington, or for securing them in any jail, so that he shall get them.<BR>$25 will be given for such information (lodged with Mr. H. Whitford, W. W. Clark, in Newbern, or the subscriber,) as shall lead to the apprehension of Toney, and $10 for similar information respecting Nelly.<BR>ELIJAH CLARK.<BR>Washington, Feb. 7th, 1834    72tf
