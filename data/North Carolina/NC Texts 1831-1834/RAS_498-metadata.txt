Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on Sunday last, a Negro man named CAESAR. He is about 20 years of age, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, slender made, black complexion and speaks and moves quickly. He had a coarse white cotton Shirt and Trowsers, a black bombazette Coat, black cloth Pantaloons, and a black hair Cap. He was seen on Monday morning last, on the Wilmington road, about 4 miles from Newbern, and it is probable that he will endeavour to get on board of some vessel at Wilmington and effect his escape to the North. Masters of vessels and all others are forewarned from habouring, employing, or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law. A reward of $15 will be paid for his apprehension and confinement in jail, if he be taken within the limits of this State, and $25 if apprehended out of the State.<BR>WILLIAM V. BARROW.<BR>Craven County, 12th June 1833.   '51tf<BR>The Wilmington Advertiser and Peoples' Press, will insert the above three weeks, and forward the account to this Office.
