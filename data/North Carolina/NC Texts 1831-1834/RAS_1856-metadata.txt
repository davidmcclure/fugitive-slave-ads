Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD. <BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber, on Sunday, the 14th July, a light mulatto girl named HARRIET, about 19 years old, and five feet high. She is stout built, has straight coarse hair, which she usually wears tucked up with a comb, large blue eyes, and a flesh mole on her right cheek. She had on a dark blue calico frock and white apron.

Masters of vessels, and all others, are forewarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying her away under the penalty of the law. <BR>SALMON HALL> <BR>July 26th, 1833.
