Transcript: $25 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, in May Court week last, a bright mulatto boy named<BR>JOHN,<BR>About 19 or 20 years of age, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, thick set and well built--he has a scar under his jaw, (I think the left jaw,) and thick ancles[sic]. He is a shrewd fellow, and will perhaps alter his name and attempt to pass as a free man. His father is a free negro, named Hardy Lassiter, living on Toisnot. The above reward will be given for John's apprehension, if delivered to me in Edgecombe county, or secured in any jail so that I can get him again. All persons are hereby forbid harboring, employing, or carrying off said boy, under the penalty of the law.<BR>SAMUEL FARMER.<BR>Nov. 28, 1831.<BR>15
