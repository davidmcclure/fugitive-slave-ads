Transcript: STOP THE RUNAWAY!<BR>Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on the 4th of August, a Negro Boy named PETER. He is about 17 or 18 years of age, rather an old appearance for a boy of that age; his weight is about 120; his height five feet one or two inches; small feet and ancles[sic]; large shoulders, and a tottering walk; he has a scar on one of his hands, but it is not recollected which; he is quite black. The last account I had of him, he had on a cotton shirt and bombazette pantaloons. He will be found quite artful in telling tales in his own favor to make his escape. I suppose Peter will try to get back to the County of either Greene or Craven, as he was brought from one of them or from one of the adjoining Counties by a Speculator, about four years ago. He was seen on Monday, the 19th of August, about eight miles east of Rockingham, on the stage road leading from Rockingham to Graham's bridge.<BR>Any person taking up said Boy, can let me know it, by dropping me a few lines to Tindalsville, Anson County, North Carolina.<BR>ELIJAH RATLIFF.<BR>September 12.<BR>50tf.
