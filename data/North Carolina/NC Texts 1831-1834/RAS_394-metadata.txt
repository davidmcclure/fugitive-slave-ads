Transcript: $50 REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 11th inst., a negro man by the name of SAM, he is five feet nine or ten inches high, twenty-one or twenty-two years old, his complexion is a light or pale black, when spoken to has a soft whining voice. He was raised near Trent Bridge. I have slight reasons for believing he intends trying to get with some person and go to Alabama. All persons are forewarned from harbouring, employing, carrying or sending him away under the penalty of the law. I will give the above reward for Sam if delivered to me, or Twenty-five Dollars if secured in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>JOHN HOUSTON.<BR>Trenton, Jones County,<BR>March 17th, 1834. 29[illegible]tf.
