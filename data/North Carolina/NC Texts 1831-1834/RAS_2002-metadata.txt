Transcript: $200 Reward<BR>WILL [illegible] for the apprehension and delivery to me in this place of my two negro women EVE and SALL. Eve is the wife of Manuel, belonging to Mathew Cluff, and Sall is the wife of old George, also belonging to Mathew Cluff. Eve was seduced away by Manuel in September, 1829, and has since that time been kept out with the assitance of white persons at or near Elizabeth, and from there to the head of Pasquotank River. She is a low, thick set woman, about 26 or 27 years of age, bushy head of hair, rather thick lips, smooth, dark skin, though not very black and lisps a little when spoken to. I understand she has changed her name to Mary and has a free pass. Sall is a tall, stout woman, smooth skin, about the same complexion and age of Eve.--She was seduced away by old George on the night of the 2nd of this month, on his return from this place to Elizabeth City, where he had been to visit her as usual. His object, no doubt, is to place her with Eve, to be under the protection of that noted villian Manuel and his brothers, who were transported from this County with a view of sending them to New Orleans. I will pay the above reward for both together, with the child or children, of Eve if she has any with her, or $100 for either on delivery.<BR>JOHN WOOD.<BR>Hertford, July 27, 1833.
