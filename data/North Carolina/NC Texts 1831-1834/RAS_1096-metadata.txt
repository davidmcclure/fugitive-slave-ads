Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD,<BR>WILL be given for the apprehension and delivery in Newbern Jail of my Negro Men HUGH and JIM. They ran away from my house in Beaufort, about ten days ago.--Hugh was raised on Mr. Gaston's Plantation on Brices Creek, and I expect both of them are dodging about in the bushes at that place. Hugh is about 28 years old, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, is not a very dark negro, is trim built, with very thick lips. He wears a long, blue cloth coat occasionally. He has a pass written by my daughter, dated about two weeks ago, to go to Neuse and return, which he will probably show if interrograted. Jim is a black negro, about 25 years old, about 5 feet 6 inches high, and thick set. He was raised by Mrs. Thompson, in Beaufort, and has a wife at James T. Jones' plantation, on Clubfoot's Creek. Jim has a pass written by me, about two weeks ago, with leave to go to Clubfoot's Creek and return immediately. They have taken a longer tour than I expected, and if they return to me immediately, witout cost, I will endeavor to sell them to the man they want to live with. When Hugh reads this, he had better reflect on his error, and come home without delay. <BR>JAMES MANNEY. <BR>Beaufort, Nov. 6th, 1831.
