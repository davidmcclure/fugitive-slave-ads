Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, about the 1st of March, 1833, a likely negro fellow by the name of SCIP, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, well formed, yellow complexion, high forehead, a scar over one of his eyes, good teeth. He is about 25 years of age. He is well known about Fayetteville, having been hired during the year 1833, to Col. Samuel T. Hawley, of that town. It is probable that he is lurking about the town or its vicinity. I will give the above reward for his delivery to me, living about ten miles South East of Elizabethtown, Bladen County, on the Wilmington Road, or for his confinement in Bladen Jail, or Twenty Dollars for his confinement in any other Jail so that I get him again.<BR>SAMUEL C.
