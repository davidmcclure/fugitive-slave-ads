Transcript: RUN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Indian woods, Bertie, a negro man named TOM, a low thick fellow, very black, speaks very quick and rather broad, is some upwards of thirty years old, has had his back very much marked with the whip.  He had on when he went away a cotton shirt filled with yellow cotton, a homespun pair of breeches and boots filled with black wool, double wove, had an old hat on, and a pair of silver sleeve buttons in his sleeves.  He left me on the 23rd of August--he has a sister at Black Walnut, and has been there.  I expect he is lulking[lurking] about there or at Edenton.  Whoever will deliver the said fellow to me, or secure him in any gaol, shall be satisfied for there[their] trouble, and all reasonable charges paid.<BR>MOSES GILLAM, Overseer<BR>for Willie Jones.
