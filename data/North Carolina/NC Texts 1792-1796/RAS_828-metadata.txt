Transcript: DANIEL, a negro man slave, the property of the subscriber, run away from Newbern, about the middle of last month, he was born in Pamplico in this state: is rather of a yellowish complexion, well made, of the middle size, near forty years of age, is something bald over the temples, and perhaps he never was whipped so as to shew[show] any marks on the skin.--Daniel is fond of spirits, and a small quantity will make him noisy and troublesome. Amongst other cloathing he took with him a black velvet jacket and breeches. He is a good hand by water, and at most kind of common labour, hath been seen near the town of Bath, and will perhaps go towards Edenton. He may propably procure a pass as a free man, but as he knows very little of the state, except the town of Newbern, he may by examining be easily detected. --As Daniel once hath, he may again attempt going to sea, masters of vessels are therefore requested, if he should apply or be found on board, to secure him in some jail or if convenient bring or send him home.<BR>All reasonable expences and a suitable generous reward will be thankfully paid, to any person who will bring him to Newbern, give information, or secure him so that he may be obtained by the subscriber, who hath owned him upwards of twenty years.<BR>JAMES COOR.<BR>October 31.
