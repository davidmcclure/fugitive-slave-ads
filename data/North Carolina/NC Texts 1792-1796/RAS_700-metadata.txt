Transcript: TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN AWAY from the subscriber, a mulatto negro man named HARRY, about thirty-five years old, about five feet eight or nine inches high, stout made, hath a cross look out of one eye, and somewhat bow-legged, is very fond of liquor and is a blacksmith and cooper by trade; had on when he went away a blue cloth upper and under jacket and trousers of the same, black stockings, with white tops, a brown great coat, and wears shoes constantly.  I do expect he is endeavouring to go to the northward, and therefore give notice to all masters of vessels not to take him on board under the penalty of the law.  Any person who will bring the said negro to me in Martin county, or secure him in any gaol so that I get him, shall receive the above reward, if taken at the bar, or out of the state, and ten dollars if taken in any of the adjacent counties, and all necessary expences paid by<BR>FRANCIS WARD.
