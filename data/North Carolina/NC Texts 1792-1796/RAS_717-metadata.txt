Transcript: TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD,<BR>WILL be given for taking up and delivering to me, or securing in some gaol that I get him, my Negro Man YARMOUTH, who ran away about ten days past; he is about five feet nine inches high, black, with his knees pretty close, and when alarmed by fear, stutters, his eyes rather small; he has been brought up in a rope walk, and very ready at work in rigging; from which circumstance, I judge he will endeavour to get a passage to the northward in a vessel; but I hope, as he cost me the price of four common negroes, and has never, since I owned him, received a stroke from me, no master of a vessel would be guilty of so high an offence to justice, as to endeavour to deprive me of him; and they may rest assured that I shall fend through all the northern states in pursuit of him, and if transported hence by any vessel, the utmost rigour of the law will be pursued.  He may be lurking about Edenton, as he there obtained his trade, in Mr. Collins's rope-walk.<BR>WHITMILL HILL.<BR>February 3, 1793.
