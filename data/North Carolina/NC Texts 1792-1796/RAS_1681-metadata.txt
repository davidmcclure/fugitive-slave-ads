Transcript: RUN away, in October last, two Negro Slaves, viz. a yellow wench named BEC, and her brother called SIP.  Bec is about 18 years of age, and has a natural black mark round her left eye; she is supposed to be lurking about Mr Pollock's Quarter, on Chowan. Sip is a yellow boy, about 14 years of age, and marked GMK on both his cheeks for his frequently running away.  He always says when brought home, that white people persuade him off, and even harbour him.  A reward of Thirty Dollars will be given to any person informing of their being harboured by a white person, upon conviction of the culprit; Forty Shillings for finding one or both in any negro cabin, and Five Dollars for each brought home to me at Plymouth.<BR>GEORGE MACKENZIE.
