Transcript: FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN away on Friday, the 7th inst., a Negro Wench named Sall, about 30 years of age, tall and of a yellow complexion, she carried away a good many cloths[sic] and will be able to dress very well ; she may attempt to pass for a free woman, by the name of SALLY HARRIS, as all her cloths are marked S.H.  She has a great stock of assurance, which may deceive, she has lost part of one ear, which was bit off in a fight ; she had a stroke over her left eye, just before she went away, which may occasion a scar.  She is very foul of spirits.  The above reward will be paid to whoever delivers her to DAVID DAY.
