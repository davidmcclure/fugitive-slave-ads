Transcript: RUNAWAY from the subscriber, on 4th inst. a very likely country-born Negro Fellow, named JOE, 23 years of age, about five feet eight inches high, well set, very black, has no beard, has a remarkable scar on one of his legs, about the instep, occasioned, he say, by a waggon[sic] wheel running over it when he was a boy; his back is much scared[sic] by the whip.  He was raised by General Jones at one of his quarters near Halifax town.  It is uncertain what rout[sic] he may take--about two weeks after he went off he was seen on the south side of Tar river, above Mr. Lamond's--at some places he enquired the way to Georgia, at others the way to Newbern, where he said he wanted to get on board of a vessel.  Masters of vessels are hereby forwarned[sic] at their peril, from employing or carrying him off.  Any person who will bring him home, or confine him in any gaol so that he may be had again, shall be handsomely rewarded for their trouble, and have all necessary charges paid.<BR>FIGURES LEWIS<BR>Edgcomb[sic] county, about 19 miles above Tarborough<BR>May 30.<BR>N.B. Should any person take up said Fellow, I will find it necessary to keep him well secured, as he be very artful in getting away.    99 3
