Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD <BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on Saturday the 10th of May last, a negro fellow named Wilson, and a negro girl named Milly.  They are both northern bred negroes. <BR>The fellow is about twenty four years old, of a yellowish complexion; nearly five feet four inches high; has long thick lips, a slim look, and has lost one of his foreteeth.  He is big round the shoulders and small round the waist. <BR>The girl is about thirteen or fourteen years old, has a likely look. <BR>They were both dressed in what is commonly called nankeen cotton.  The fellow formerly belonged to capt.[captain] John Jones, of Newbern; I expect they will endeavour to pass for free negroes: they carried away all their lodging clothes among which is a pale blue rug.  It is likely they are gone towards Brice or Adam's creek. <BR>All masters of vessels are forwarned from carrying them away out of the state, and all others from harbouring or concealing them. <BR>The above reward will be paid to any person that will deliver them to me, or so confine them that I may get them again. <BR>JOHN DUBERLEY. <BR>June 7.
