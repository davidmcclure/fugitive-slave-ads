Transcript: Eight Dollars Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber, early in last month, a Negro Man, named HARPER, yellow complexion, nearly or quite six foot high, very well made and active, about 25 years old, speaks good English, and for a negro is sensible.  He was bred somewhere about Mosely's ferry on Roanoke, and formerly belonged to a person by the name of Mosely, in that neighborhood--negroes of his acquaintance say his mother lives thereabouts, and that he told them he was going to see her.  About three years ago he belonged to Mr. Benjamin Smith of Wake, of whom I bought him.  The above reward shall be given to any person who will secure him in gaol or otherwise so that I can get him, and if brought to Fayetteville all reasonable charges shall be paid.<BR>JAMES PORTERFIELD.<BR>Fayetteville, March 1.
