Transcript: RAN away from the subscriber, on the 19th inst. a Negro Boy named Jack, about nineteen years old, five feet and ten inches high, very artful and sensible, and will endeavour to pass for a free boy. He was late the property of Captain Hosmer; and as he was brought up to the sea. I expect he will try to get on board of some vessel with an intention of going to New-England, where he was born.<BR> Whoever will take up said Negro Boy, and deliver him to the subscriber or to secure him that he may get him again, shall receive if taken in this country FORTY SHILLINGS and if taken out of this county, FOUR POUNDS reward.<BR> If he has left this town I suppose he will try to get to Washington to take shipping there.<BR> All masters of vessels, and others, are hereby forwarned from harbouring, employing, or carrying him away, as the subscriber is determined to prosecute with the utmost rigor of the law, any person so offending.<BR> JOSEPH PITTMAN<BR>Newbern, March 20.
