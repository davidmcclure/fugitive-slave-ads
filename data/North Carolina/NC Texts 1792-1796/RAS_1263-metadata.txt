Transcript: FIVE POUNDS REWARD.<BR>ON Monday last, run away from the subscriber's plantation, in Tyrrell county, a likely negro man named ANDREW, about twenty-five years of age, near six feet high, well made; he has a small scar in his forehead, occasioned by the kick of mare; it is uncertain what clothes he has on, but he wishes to be dressy.  It is expected he will endeavour to get on board some vessel to go out of the country.  The above reward will be given for apprehending and delivering the said fellow to me, in Bertie county, or my overseer, George Dawson, in Tyrrell county, if taken out of the counties of Bertie and Tyrrell; or three pounds, if taken in either of these counties.  All masters of vessels are hereby forewarned taking or shipping the above fellow on board their vessels, or carrying him out of the country.  I expect he will endeavour to get a free pass.<BR>HUMPHRY HARDY.<BR>July 15, 1794.    3
