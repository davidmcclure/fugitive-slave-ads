Transcript: RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, living on Tar river, Pitt county, a negro man by the name of PRINCE, about 21 years old, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, he's a black Negro, spare made, Guinea born, speaks the English tongue, so that he may be understood very well; he has been branded with W.G. on both cheeks, but part of some of the letters scarcely can be seen. Any person that will take up the said negro, and put him in any gaol in this state, so that I get him, or will fetch him to me, shall have Ten Dollars Reward. As he has attempted to get aboard of a vessel I am induced to forwarn all Masters of Vessels from carrying him out of the state, or any other person from employing him, under the penalty of the Law.<BR>WILLIAM GRIMES.<BR>Pitt County Tar River<BR>June 24, 1795.<BR> N.B. He generally goes about in the day time, and depends upon his ingenuity to frame an artful tale, when suspected and questioned.
