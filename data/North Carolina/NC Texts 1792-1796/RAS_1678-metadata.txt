Transcript: RUN AWAY from the subscriber, on Saturday the 25th inst. a very likely country born Negro Fellow, named MOSES, about 30 years of age, five feet ten or eleven inches high, well set, very black, smooth spoken, and very humble to white people: Had on when he went away, a white woollen jacket, black woollen trowzers[sic], a tow shirt and a new felt hat; carried off sundry other clothes.  He was raised near Edenton by Mr. Samuel Halsey, has a mother living at Governor Johnston's quarter, on Roanoke river, below Halifax, and it is expected he will endeavour to get to one of those places.  All masters of vessels are forwarned at their peril, from employing or carrying the said Fellow out of the state.  Any person who will apprehend and bring him home, or confine him in any gaol so that I get him again, shall be handsomely rewarded for their trouble, and all necessary charges paid.<BR>BYTHAL BELL.<BR>Edgecomb county, near Tarborough, April 2[illegible]
