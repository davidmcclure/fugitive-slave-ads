Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD,<BR>WILL be given, for taking up and delivering to me, or securing so that I get him again, a NEGRO MAN, named ISAAC, who ran away about fifteen days past.  He is about five feet nine inches high, well made and twenty five years of age. He took with him a short blue coat and breeches, and I have reason to believe that he is lurking in Perquimans county, where I understand he has lately taken a wife. He left me without any cause whatever for absenting himself.  I trust that no master of a vessel will carry him away, and I shall be under the necessity of prosecuting him to the utmost vigour of the law.<BR>STEPHEN CABARRUS.<BR>Edenton, March 20, 1793.
