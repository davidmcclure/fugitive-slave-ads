Transcript: EIGHT DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 30th of December last, a bright mulatto man, named SAM, about 25 years of age.  He is so near being white, that he may easily impose himself for a white man; his eyes, hair, and eye brows are very black, his teeth are very much decayed, and he has a natural mark on one ear, a tit or bit of flesh resembling a cherry with which he was born.  He carried with him sundry good clothes, one pearl coloured superfine cloth coat, one coarse light blue do, and a number of other good homespun clothes, one pair shoe boots and a violin, upon which he attempts to play.  The above reward will be given to any person that will apprehend the said fellow and secure him so that I get him again, and all reasonable expences[sic] paid.<BR>ROBERT FREEMAN.<BR>Warren county, January 28  86  4t
