Transcript: Fifteen Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN-away on the night of the 27th of April, two negroes of the following description, to wit:<BR>ANTHONY,<BR>about 24 years old, five feet nine or ten inches high, likely, well made, and of an erect carriage. He speaks both French and English, but his English is broken. He carried among other clothes, a sailor's jacket of blue cloth, also another of spotted callico bound with white, a red waist-coat, and a pair of striped overalls with a patch on each knee. The other,<BR>JOHN,<BR>about 35 years old, nearly the same height and rather droop shouldered. He also speaks French and English more unintelligibly than Anthony. They were from the lower part of this state, their intention being to get on board some vessel for the West-Indies, therefore all masters of vessels are forwarned from harbouring or carrying them off. The above reward I will give for their delivery to me, paying all necessary expences.<BR>OLIVER SMITH.<BR>Greenville, May 2, 1796.
