Transcript: RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, the 30th of May last, in Moore county, about thirty miles above Fayetteville, a likely Negro Man, named BOB about nineteen years old, five feet eight or nine inches high, dark complexion, thin visage, large thick lips and very smiling countenance : He lately came from Maryland, and I expect he will endeavour to get there again.  He had on when he went away an oznabrigs shirt and striped country cloth overhalls[sic].  There is a probability that he has by some means obtained a pass.  Any person who will deliver him to me, in Rockingham county, on Haw River, or secure him in any gaol, so that I get him again, shall be handsomely rewarded.<BR>JOHN COFFEE<BR>July 1, 1794   4 4
