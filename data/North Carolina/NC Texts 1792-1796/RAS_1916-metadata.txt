Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber on the 13th instant, a Negro man named DUKE, about 27 years of age, five feet 10 or 11 inches high, black complected, large, well set, and very bow legged.  He is very sensible, can read and write, and most probably has procured a forged pass ; he carried with him a negro cotton great coat, the balance of his clothes are unknown.  I expect this fellow intends for Georgia-- Whoever takes him up and secures him in jail so that I get him again shall receive the above reward, and if brought home all reasonable expenses.<BR>WILLIAM PERKINS.<BR>Mush-Island, Halifax county,<BR>December 21, 1795
