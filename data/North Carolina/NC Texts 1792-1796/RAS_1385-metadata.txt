Transcript: TEN DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RAN-AWAY from the subscriber, living on Neuse near Smithfield, about the 9th of January: a Negroe man named AMS, who carried off with him a Negroe woman named SYLVIA and a Child of about three years old.  The Negroe man is a remarkable stout fellow, with a sore on his face, and is of a very dark complexion: the woman is rather low and stocky made, of a yellowish complexion.  I have reason to expect they have obtained a pass, and will probably bend their course for Virginia.  Whosoever will secure the said negroes in a gaol, so that I get them, shall receive the above reward and all reasonable expenses paid by<BR>WILLIAM GUY<BR>January 30.   26 4
