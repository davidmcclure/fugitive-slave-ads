Transcript: FORTY DOLLARS REWARD<BR>RAN away from the town of Fayetteville on the night of the 25th May, 1796, a likely negro wench named ABBEY, of middle height and well fed, yellow complexion, speaks plain English, and nearly forty years of age.--She carried away with her a variety of clothes, some of which are very good.  Her husband went off with her--he is a bright mulatto fellow named BEN, about five feet six inches high, bow leg'd, narrow visage, high forehead, his hair intermixed with white, and nearly fifty years of age, was branded in November last, on the left cheek H and on the right S, but it is uncertain whether said brands are discoverable.  It is quite probable they will keep together, and will likely make toward Suffolk in Virginia, the wench having been raised in the neighborhood of that place.  I will give Twenty Dollars for the wench delivered to me in Fayetteville; and I am authorized by Mr. Henry Stevens to say that he will give Twenty Dollars for the fellow, delivered to him at his house in the fork of the Neuse river and Mill creek, Johnston county.<BR>WINSHIP STEDMAN<BR>N.N. They will probably be supplied with passes, or endeavour to pass for free.<BR>June 13  04  54
