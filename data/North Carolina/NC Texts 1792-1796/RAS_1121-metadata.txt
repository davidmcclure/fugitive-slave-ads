Transcript: FIVE POUNDS REWARD.<BR>RUN AWAY this morning from the subscriber in Nixonton, a NEGRO FELLOW by the name of SAMPSON, (formerly the property of John Hamilton, Esq.[Esquire]) aged about 45 years, an African by birth, but talks plain English, has a grave or rather surly look, of a religious turn it is said, and frequently talking to himself; had on when he went away, a blue short coat, a Bath coating jacket, blue trowsers, and a grey great coat; he also took with him a new brown short coat, two pair of breeches, one of corduroy and the other of brown fearnoughts, and sundry other good cloaths.  It is supposed he has taken with him a black horse with small ears and a large head, about 14 hands high.  It is presumed that a further description would be unnecessary, as the above named fellow is well known in the district, having frequently rode express through the country, and often as a servant to his former owner.  I will give the above reward to any person securing him in the district gaol of Edenton.<BR>FRANCIS POIRE.<BR>Nixonton, April 26, 1792.
