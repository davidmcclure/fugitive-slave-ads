Transcript: TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.<BR>RUN AWAY on the 4th inst. a mulatto fellow named EDWIN; he is strong and well made, about twenty-three years of age, five feet seven or eight inches high, has a full bushy head of hair, or wool; I believe no scars or marks from whipping on his back; he has been several voyages to sea, and being a very bright mulatto, do believe he will attempt to pass as a free man: He is a good hand at the whip-saw, understands tying twine and mending a seine, and is handy at all kinds of plantation business.  He has worked a little in a blacksmith's shop and a ship yard.  He had on a coating jacket, which he may change, as he has a variety of good clothes, amongst them a pale blue cloth coat, but whether or not he has carried these clothes with him, I do not know.<BR>The above reward, and all reasonable expences, will be paid to any person who will bring him to me, or secure him in gaol, so that I may get him.<BR>All masters of vessels are forbid employing, or harbouring the above slave.<BR>H. MURFREE.<BR>State of North Carolina, Hartford County, Murfreesborough, 7th<BR>March, 1795.
