Transcript: RUN away from the subscriber the 16th of June last, a likely country born negro named, BOB, he is 32 years of age, about five feet eight or nine inches high, of a yellow complexion, and speaks plain English, has a large scar across his nose and one on the top of one of his feet, occasioned by the cut of an axe; he has been shot since, cut, and wounded in the right foot, it is supposed he will endeavour to pass for a free man, and as he is very artful, many probably produce a pass for that purpose. Whoever will apprehend and secure said negro in any public gaol, so that I may get him again,  shall receive the above reward and if delivered to me, in Jones county, an addition of all reasonable charges shall be paid.<BR>LEVIN LANE.<BR>Jones county, August 9th, 1794.
