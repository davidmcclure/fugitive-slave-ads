Transcript: Ten Pound Reward.  RUN AWAY from the subscriber, on the 8th day of March, in the year 1790 a likely negro man named LUKE, about 19 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches high, black complexion, and a pleasing countenance when spoken to--remarkable small legs to the size of his body, occasioned by a scald--his ankles are rather larger than any other part of his legs--the sinews in his insteps being contracted lies exceeding high, which draws and crooks his feet inwards, and renders him incapable of working them in his ankle joints.  He was seen near the Catawba river, pretending to pass for a freeman, by the name of JACK SCOTT.  Whoever apprehends said negro and conveys him to me, in Halifax County, shall receive the above reward.<BR>GEORGE MORRIS, SEN.<BR>NOVEMBER 23, 1792  22--2
