Transcript: FIFTEEN DOLLARS REWARD<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, living near Hillsborough, Orange county, N.C. on the 15th of October last, a NEGRO MAN named STEPHEN, about 20 years old, 5 feet 3 or 4 inches high ; took with him a store hat of a good quality, bound with a band and buckle to it, a striped coat of a copperas color, and blue and white striped jacket & pantaloons--his other cloaths were homespun, 2 blankets, one old, the other a new roase blanket.  He has a stoppage in his speech, and when rather scared or surprised stutters a good deal.<BR>At the same time he took a Black Mare, heavy with soal, without shoes, 5 years old last spring, one hind foot [illegible] to the [illegible] her [illegible] hangs to the left side, a switch tail; she is well formed, about 13 hands 3 inches high.  He has carried with him a good bridle, with plated bits, a horsewhip, &c. He is an artful, cunning fellow, he probably may have procured a pass by some means, in order to see his father, who, I am informed, lives below Raleigh.  I will give the above Reward to any person who will secure him, so that I get him and the Mare again; and should they be taken up separately, I will give Ten Dollars for the Negro Fellow, and Five for the Mare, on the delivery of them.<BR>ANDREW MURDOCH,<BR>November 1st, 1809    3t--29
