Transcript: NOTICE<BR>RAN-AWAY<BR>From the subscriber on Tuesday the 22d of August, 1809.<BR>A Likely Negro woman named HANNAH.  She carried all her cloths [sic] with her, and some cloth of different sorts.  She is of the common size and sensible : she has been used to house bussiness[sic].  As she went off without any cause, I am at a loss to know her intentions.  I will give Five Dollars for apprehending and bringing her to me if in my neighborhood, and Ten if out of it, or to have her confined in any jail in the United States.  I suppose that she has gone to Tarborough, as she has some acquaintance with Mr. Porie's Negroes, and in the family of Mr. Dudley.<BR>JOHN TILLERY.<BR>Connoconary, Aug. 28, 1809.
