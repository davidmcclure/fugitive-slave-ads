Transcript: Forty Dollars Reward. <BR>A reward of Forty Dollars will be given to any one who will apprehend and secure in the Wilmington jail the following Negro Women: Harriet, Bella, Elsey and Milly. HARRIET is a tall thin wench of a yellowish complexion about thirty two or thirty three years of age, well known in Wilmington, where her parents are and supposed to be harbored in the neighborhood of Town Creek Bridge. BELLA a short wench--her complexion similar to that of Harriets, who I have reason to belive is secreted in town. ELSEY is also a short wench, her complexion deeper than either of the others, has remarkable white teeth and speaks quick--She is supposed to be frequently in town and at Mr. George Mackenzie's plantation (Lilliput) where she has a husband--she is about twenty-five years of age. MILLY is a slender wench of the common height, her complexion very much of the mulatto; she is about three and twenty years of age and may be found either in town or at Mr. George MacKenzie's plantation. Forty dollars will be given for their delivery in the Wilmington jail or ten for either of them.<BR>WILLIAM H. MACKENZIE.<BR>April 1.
