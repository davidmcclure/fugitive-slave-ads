Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 29th day of December last, a negro man named Simon, about 27 years old, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, dark complected, heavy made; a scar on his head, one near his left eye, and one on his neck.  He will no doubt endeavor to pass for a free man, and make for some free State.  When apprehended, a few days ago, some forged free papers were found on him.  He again made his escape, and will probably attempt to get to Milton or Fayetteville, for the purpose of going off in some boat.  The above reward will be paid for the delivery of said negro to me, or for his confinement in any Jail so that I regain him.<BR>JOHN F. BURNETT, Jun.[Junior]<BR>Chatham County, N.C. Jan. 7.    49tf
