Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 13th inst. a negro man named JOHN; he is 50 years of age, of a yellow complexion, about five feet eight or ten inches high, he has a cancer on his heel, and I suspect will try to pass for a freeman.  He will probably aim to go to Washington county, Virginia, to one Jacob Miller, living sixteen miles from Abingdon.  Any information on the said negro John will be thankfully received and if apprehended so that I get him, shall be handsomely rewarded.<BR>John S. Glenn.<BR>Oxford, Nov. 17  61--3w
