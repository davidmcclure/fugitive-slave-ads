Transcript: Twenty five Dollars<BR>REWARD.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on Saturday night last, a bright complexioned negro man, named<BR>AUSTIN,<BR>About six feet in height, well built, hair inclined to being bushy, and about thirty-five years old; the thumb of his right hand is at present sore, affected by whitlow; one of his hands, wrist, and one side of his face is scarred in consequence of being burnt when young; he can read and write tolerable well and has some knowledge of figures;he talks much through his nose; he is a good rough carpenter and an excellent field hand. Said negro had on when he ranaway, a suit of brown homespun; and took with him a considerable quantity of other clothing; he is a cunning artful fellow and will probably attempt to pass as a free man; it is probable he will be accompanied by a white woman with whom he was intimate, and who has left the neighborhood. The above reward will be paid for his delivery to me, or secured in any jail so that I can get him again.<BR>Joel Harris.<BR>Halifax co. Feb. 16, 1825. 48-tf
