Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber about the middle of Nov.[November] last, a negro fellow named HARRY, about 5 feet 10 inches high, yellow complected, and rather stout, wore off domestic clothes, which were all he took with him.  He was brought from Person county, near the Virginia line, about 12 years ago, and I think it probable he may endeavor to get back there, and will probably attempt to pass for a free man.  Any information which may lead to the recovery of the said negro, will be compensated with the above reward.<BR>JESSE WAMBLE.<BR>Chatham County, on Deep river, 6 miles from Tyson's Post Office.<BR>March 31.--8-6wpd.
