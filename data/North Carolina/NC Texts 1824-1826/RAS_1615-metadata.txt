Transcript: Ranaway.<BR>FROM the Subscriber, living twelve miles due west from Raleigh, on the night of the 3d inst. two Negro Men, father and son, the former belonging to the Subscriber, and the latter to Stephen Lowe.  The oldest Negro is named Romulus-he is about 40 years of age, yellow complected, his fore teeeth nearly all decayed and is very knock-kneed when he walks.  He carried with him the following clothing, a blue broad-cloth Coat, a pair of grey, and a pair of white pantaloons, and fur hat, entirely new; also a plaid cloak, striped with green with sleeves in it. Romulus has another mark, which will render it easy to identify him, if he is examined, viz. a very large scar on one of his legs.  There is but little doubt that said negro has a considerable sum of money about him, and may therefore endeavor to pass for a free man, as was the case about 19 years since, when he runaway, took with him free papers and assumed the name of Chavis.<BR>The other is named Willis.  He is about 15 years old, rather of a lighter complexion than his father, and is a very likely boy. Said negro has no marks as is recollected, but took a fur hat with him considerably worn, a new tow shirt made without wristbands and with no sleeve or collar buttons, a mixed coat and a pair of white cotton pantaloons.<BR>I will give a reward of $10 if they are taken within the county, or $25 if taken out of the county, and confined in any Jail so that I get them again.<BR>JAMES LOWE.<BR>Wake county, June 5.     66
