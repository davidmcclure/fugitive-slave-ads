Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward. <BR>  NEGRO man named AARON ran away from the subscriber about the first of last month, 1. With the notorious Jonathan Rector, who has been lurking in the woods for a year past in different parts of Iredell county, generally having runaway negroes with him, and who was caught lately, it is reported, near Center Church, and had Lynch's law inflicted upon him; <BR> 2. In this neighborhood of Sherril's Ford, in Lincoln county, where he formerly had a wife and other  connexions;<BR> 3. About a plantation of the late Archibald Henderson, Esq.[Esquire] on the Yadkin river, in the neighborhood of Salisbury, where he is said to have a brother;<BR> Or he may be in the neighborhood of Mr. Alexander Gillespie, in Mecklenburg county, as he has a brother and other relations in that part of the country.<BR> As Rector has received a hint (the third one, it is said of Lynch's sort) to leave our county, it is probable he may travel off with his dark skin'd companions, and make sale[?] of them at a distance. <BR> Aaron is about forty years of age, but would pass for much younger, were it not that his head is a little grey. He is about five feet and from eight to ten inches high, well made, very black and smooth skinned, pleasant countenance, [illegible] plays the fiddle, and is a plausible, likely fellow. <BR>  His clothing is not known; but he is supposed to have him a good supply.<BR>The above reward will be paid to any person who delivers Aaron to me at my house, free of charges; or ten dollars to any one who apprehends him, and secures him in some gaol, so that I get him. <BR> JOHN. F. BREVARD. <BR>  Iredell county, near Beatty's Ford, <BR> May 24, 1826.  3t15
