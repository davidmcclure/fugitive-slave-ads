Transcript: $50 Reward FOR CUT-FINGER CAD,<BR>WHO took himself off on Sunday the 30th of last month for Lexington (as he informed his comrades, I being from home) to see a Wife he claimed near there--But from his carrying all his best clothes, consisting of two Frock Coast, a blue and bottle green, also a blue close -bodied Coat, and several pair of nice pantaloons and waistcoats, together with a Dirk and Pistol he had procured to travel with, I have no doubt his object is to pass as a free man.<BR>He is a yellow fellow of common size, bushy head of hair rather curled, with very large feet and hands, has lost the forefinger of one of his hands (I believe his left.)<BR>He was hired for most of the two last years to William Nichols, Esq. and worked at Chapel Hill and Lexington, which course he may attempt to pass again as a hired fellow.<BR>I will give $25 for the securing him in any Jail so that I get him, and $50 if taken without the limits of this State, secured, &c.<BR>JO.[Joseph] HAWKINS.<BR>Raleigh, N.C. Feb. 7.<BR>The Editors of the Fayetteville Observer, Cape Fear Recorder, Carolina Sentinel, Western Carolinian, Edenton Gazette, and Petersburg Intelligencer, are required to insert the above twice, and forward their accounts to this office for collection.<BR>J.H.
