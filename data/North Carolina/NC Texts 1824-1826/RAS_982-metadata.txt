Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY, on the 16th instant, my negro man ISAAC. He is about 40 years of age, black complexion, full face, of low statue[sic], but bulky; smiles when spoken to. He has no marks by which I could well describe him, save a long scar on his right hand, which extends from the lower joint of the thumb to the wrist. His dress I do not recollect. He has a wife belonging to Jesse Cooper, who has lately removed to the South, and, no doubt, Isaac is in pursuit of said wife. I will give the above reward for said fellow, if delivered to me, or twenty-five dollars, if confined in any Jail, so I can get him.<BR>JAMES KNIGHT.<BR>Edgecombe county, N.C.}<BR>April 20, 1825.} 18-4w
