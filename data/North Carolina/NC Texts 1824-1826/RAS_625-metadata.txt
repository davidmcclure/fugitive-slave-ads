Transcript: Twenty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber on the 29th November last, his Negro man CALEB. He is about five feet six inches high; yellow complexion; a little marked with the small pox--has lost some of his fore teeth, and is an excellent cooper.  He is about thirty-six years old, and was bought in Norfolk, Virginia, in the year 1803, to which place, or to Newbern, N.C. I think it probable he will go.  I will give Twenty Dollars to any person who will confine him in any jail so that I get him again.<BR>DAVID HOOKS.<BR>Duplin County, N.C. January 10th, 1825<BR>The Editors of the Norfolk Beacon are requested to give the above three insertions, and forward their account to the Postmaster, Newbern.
