A description of the child is unnecessary, as it will doubtless be found with its mother.--They have been traced to the vicinity of Newbern, about which they are probably lurking.  They were permitted to pass through the country, upon their reporting that they were free, and that their residence was in Newbern.<BR>The above reward, and reasonable expenses, will be paid for the apprehension and confinement in jail, of said negroes, upon information being given me that will lead to their recovery.  Or, a reward of $20 will be given for Jarvis.<BR>Masters of vessels and others are cautioned from carrying away, harbouring or employing, the aforesaid salves as the law in such case, will be strictly enforced.<BR>KINCHEN Q.
