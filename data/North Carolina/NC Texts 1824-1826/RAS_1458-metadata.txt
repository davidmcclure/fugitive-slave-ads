Transcript: 100 Dollars Reward. <BR> RAN AWAY, on the 16th of October, 1824, a negro man named Adam, aged 27 years. He was lodged in the jail of Randolph county on the 19th or 20th inst; and was taken out of said jail on the 8th of November, 1824, by the subscriber, and taken on home, with a pair of hand-cuffs on. On arriving at the subscriber's house, on the 9th of November, 1824, he was left in a room with a small boy: whist the family was at supper in another room, by some means Adams slipt out of the door, and made his escape. A the time he was taken up, he had several free papers in his possession. <BR>The said boy Adam has a scar on his right hand, occasioned by a wagon wheel. He had on, when he went away, a snuff-colored surtout coat, with hand-cuffs, well rivetted. He has heretofore passed as a brickmaker, and as a free man when last taken up. One hundred dollars reward will be given for the apprehension and delivery of said negro.<BR>'2t46   MACK CRUMP.<BR> Davidson County, N.C. Nov. 9, 1824.
