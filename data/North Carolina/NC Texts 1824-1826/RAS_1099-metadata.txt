Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward. <BR> RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the night of the 28th day of November last, his negro man, known by the name of BILL, aged about 45 years, and near six feet high; no particular marks recollected; has rather a yellowish complexion; sound teeth, the foreteeth rather inclined to be black, occasioned by chewing tobacco; has a very brazen saucy countenance; when spoken to, speaks in a very impolite, abrupt manner; very slim legs; and long hallow feet for the color. He carried off four full suits, two hats, two pair of shoes, one superfine black broad-cloath coat; one great coat of the very best quality, line with new red flannel; between 40 and 50 dollars, about $30 specie. I expect that he has aimed for Tennessee state, Carroll county. It is highly probable he has obtained a free pass, from some person or persons, and intends passing as a free man. I will give the above reward if he is taken out of this state and confined in some jail, so that I get him again. <BR> NEHEMIAH HEARN. <BR> Montgomery County, N.C. <BR> Jan'ry. 18, 1826. <BR>  3mt06
