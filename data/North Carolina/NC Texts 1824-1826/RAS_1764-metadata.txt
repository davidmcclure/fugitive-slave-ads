Transcript: Runaway<BR>FROM the Subscriber, living in Raleigh, about the 15th inst. his negro man VIRGIL. Said negro is about twenty-four years of age, dark complexion, and when spoken to is apt to stutter. There are two marks which cannot fail to lead to his apprehension if attended to.  He is lame of his left leg, and has on the crown of his head, a scar, sufficiently large to lay a finger, occasioned by its having been broken some years since.  It is possible that he may have obtained free papers, and is endeavoring to make his way to some northern city.  I will give for his delivery to me or confinement in jail, so that I get him again, $25 if taken out of the state, $10 dollars if taken out of the county, or $5 if caught in the county.<BR>JOHN BUFFALOE.<BR>Raleigh, June 27, 1825    69-
