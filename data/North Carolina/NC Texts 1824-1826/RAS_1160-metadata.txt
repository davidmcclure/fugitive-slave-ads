He is about twenty-seven years of age, about five feet eight inches high, fleshy and muscular, one of his legs much bent in at the joint.  It is supposed that he is harboured some where between my house and the University, or perhaps has made his way to Fayetteville.  The above reward will be paid on his being lodged in any jail in the State, so that I get him again, or on his delivery at my house.<BR>I will also pay $40 to any person who will give me information so that I may be enabled to convict any white man or woman of harbouring him.<BR>EDWARD JONES.<BR>Rock Rest, Chatham County, June 1, 1826.   70:4w.<BR>The Editors of the Raleigh Register are requested to give the above advertisement four insertions.
