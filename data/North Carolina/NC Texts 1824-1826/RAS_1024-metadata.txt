Transcript: FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD<BR>RANAWAY in the summer of 1823, a Negro man named TOM, or as he sometimes calls himself Tom Whitfield.-- He formerly belonged to the late Mrs. McCabe, of Newbern, in which place and neighborhood he is well known as a House Painter, having followed that business several years.  He is about 5 feet 6 inches high, from 35 to 40 years of age, and of dark complexion.  I expect he is lurking about Newbern, or some part of Craven County.  The above reward and reasonable expenses will be paid for the apprehension of Tom, and for his confinement in jail so that I get him.  Masters of vessels and others are forbid carrying away or harboring said Negro.<BR>R. J. POWELL.<BR>Smithfield, Johnston County, Nov. 4, 1825--1y
