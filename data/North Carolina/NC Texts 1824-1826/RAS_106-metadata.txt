Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR>FROM the subscriber on the 13th inst. a negro man named JOHN; he is 50 years of age, of a yellow complexion, about five feet eight or ten inches high, he has a cancer on his heel, and I suspect will try to pass for a freeman.

Any information on the said negro John will be thankfully received and if apprehended so that I get him, shall be handsomely rewarded.<BR>John S. Glenn.<BR>Oxford, Nov. 17  61--3w
