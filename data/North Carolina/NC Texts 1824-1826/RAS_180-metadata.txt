Transcript: $10 Reward.<BR>RUNAWAY from the subscriber on Thursday the 29th of Dec. last, his negro man DICK. He is about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, compactly made, and is quite an active, intelligent boy--he generally wears his hair plaited or combed up, and has the appearance of a waitingman, having frequently acted in that capacity.  His clothing is various, none particularly recollected except a pair of blue pantaloons nearly new.  I will give the above reward if taken out of the county, and delivered to me about 9 miles east of Raleigh, or if taken in the county and secured in Jail, so that I get him again; or twenty dollars if taken out of the State.<BR>D.W. STONE.<BR>Wake county, Jan. 3.    23
