Transcript: Ran Away <BR>From the subscriber, on the evening of the 5th inst. a negro woman by the name of BET. When she went off, she had on a homespun coperas[sic] frock, and carried two other frocks, with her, one a blue striped homespun, the other a red flowered Calico, she was barefoot, and without a bonnet on her head. She is between twenty five and thirty years of age, dark complected, common size, rather fleshy, teeth remarkably white, a scar on one side of her neck, occasioned by a whip. I expect she will aim for Bladen county, as she was brought from there last March 12 months ago. A liberal reward will be given to any person for the apprehension of said negro, and lodging her in Jail, so that I get her again.<BR>BERRY TIPPER.<BR>Wake county, May 8, 1826.<BR>20-4t
