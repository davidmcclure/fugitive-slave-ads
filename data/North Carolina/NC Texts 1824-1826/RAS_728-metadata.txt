Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 6th of February last, his Negro Girl PEGGY. She is about 16 years of age, and is a bright mulatto, about the ordinary height, with straight hair and tolerable good features--she has an common broad foot at her neck occasioned by a burn. She will no doubt attempt to pass for a free girl, and it is likely she has obtained a free pass.  She has a down look when spoken to, and not remarkably intelligent.  She speaks quick, with a shrill voice. She had on when she went away a coarse cotton frock--her clothes are mostly homespun--she had one calico and one cambric dress.  There is no doubt but she has changed her clothes.  I will give the above reward for her if taken out of the county and secured in any jail so that I get her again, or fifteen dollars if taken in the county and delivered to me.<BR>JOHN DARK.<BR>Chatham county, May 17.    62cof
