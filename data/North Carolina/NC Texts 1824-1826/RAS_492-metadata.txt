Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 29th of December, 1825, living in Chatham county, near the Red Field Ford, on Haw River a negro man, named SIMON five feet seven or eight inches high, dark complected, tolerably heavy made, about twenty seven years old, and has a scar near his left eye, and I believe on on the side of his neck and on his head. I expect he has a free pass, as he was apprehended, and two or three taken from him, and made his escape and I expect some Clerk's name is assigned to it, by way of forgery, and perhaps some county seal. No doubt he will try to pass for a free negro, and intends to try to get to some free state. I expect he will make for Milton or Fayetteville, and try to get in some boat. I will give the above reward; if delivered to me or lodged in some Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>JOHN F BURNETT.<BR>January 5, 1826.<BR>3-tf
