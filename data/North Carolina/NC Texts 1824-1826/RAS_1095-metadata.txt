Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward,<BR>FOR RANSOM and HANNAH.<BR>RANSOM ranaway from Mark C. Duke, Esq.[Esquire] about the 10th of June last.  He is a very noted fellow, his right knee being very much bent inward, stutters very much, and has a very down look.  His dress when he went off was light-colored homespun, but he had with him other clothing.  Ransom is about the common size, and 37 or 38 years years[sic] of age.  Hannah ranaway about about[sic] the middle of July.  She is rather above the common size, and 34 or 35 years of age, and has generally a very pleasing countenance.  The above reward will be given to any person who will deliver the said negroes to their owners, (about 14 miles below Warrenton,) or confine them in any jail, so that they get them again, or $25 for either of them.<BR>JOHN BURGES.<BR>Nov. 13, 1825.    12 1 a w 6w
