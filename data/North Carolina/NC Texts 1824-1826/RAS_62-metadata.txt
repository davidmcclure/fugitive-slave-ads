Transcript: Ran Away,<BR>FROM the subscriber, living near Raleigh, on the 19th instant, a negro girl named FANNY, 20 years old, yellow complexion, common size. I believe she has a small scar on her face, and one on her foot. She had on when she went away a homespun frock, copperas and white, blue, and white callico[sic] sun bonnet, and took with her a black bombazette and white sprig muslin frock. She will attempt to pass as a free woman, or may have a forged pass. I think she will go to Newbern, where she went on a former occasion, when she ran away, and remained sometime.<BR>I will give Ten Dollars to any person who will take her up, and secure her in Jail, so that I get her again.<BR>HARTWELL KING.<BR>Dec. 21, 1825.<BR>58-tf[?]
