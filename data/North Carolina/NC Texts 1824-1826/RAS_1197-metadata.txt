Transcript: NOTICE<BR>MY Negro Woman VINA ran-away from me some time in the month of June last.  She has lost her left hand, a middle sized negro aged about 35 years, quite black, some of her upper fore-teeth out. It is supposed she will endeavor to get to Norfolk in Virginia, as she was raised by Jesse Armstrong within 15 miles of Norfolk.  I expect some evil dishonest person gave her a pass, which perhaps, may have every appearance of a genuine one.--But as she is so very notable, I hope that some honest citizen will discover the imposition, and write me a line to Somerfield Post Office, Guilford county, N.C. (Bruce's X Roads,) and for their trouble I will handsomely reward them.<BR>JAMES PIERCE.<BR>March 11, 1825.---3t
