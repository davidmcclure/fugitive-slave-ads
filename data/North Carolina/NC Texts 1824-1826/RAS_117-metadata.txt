Transcript: Ran Away<BR>FROM the subscriber, on the 3d of this instant, Sally and her child. Sally is about thirty-four years of age, very black, white teeth & of common size. Her child Rosetta is a very bright mulatto girl, about eight years of age, with very straight hair. I purchased her in Suffolk, Va of Putnam Dickerson, in 1818. She was raised by Mr. Hatton, on the Western Branch, Va. I think she will try to get back to that place. I will give ten dollars for their confinement in jail, so I get them again, with reasonable expenses.<BR>WM.[William] W. BELL.<BR>Raleigh, April 6, 1826<BR>15 3t
