Transcript: $50 Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber about 6 years ago, a negro man named JACOB.  He is about 35 years of age, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, about the common color, tolerably active, has narrow feet, and a small scar over one of his eyes, It is probable he has altered his name, as he frequently passes from Stantonsburg to Newburn.  He has a free wife by the name of Rancy Artis, living near Stantonsburg, & it is likely he attempts to pass for free man.  The above reward will be given to any person who shall deliver said Negro to me, living five miles above Stantonsburg, or confine him in Jail, so that I get him again.  All masters of vessels are forwarned carrying him off.<BR>JOEL NEWSOM.<BR>Wayne county, Aug.7    106
