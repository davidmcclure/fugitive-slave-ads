Transcript: $100 Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the subscriber, a negro Woman named NANCY, about 20 years of age, remarkably likely, and of a pleasant expression of countenance--usually looks down, and when she raises her eyes, they have rather a white appearance. Her voice is mild, and I think her nose is a little aquiline. I have strong reason to believe the said woman was taken up about four miles above Charlotte, on or about the first of last November, since which I have heard nothing of her. The woman was of good character, and was enticed away by her husband; and I have no doubt when they were separated near Charlotte, that she would have given herself up or been taken and told to whom she belonged--which makes me believe she is concealed or stolen. Any person who will prosecute the thief to conviction, and give me information where my woman is, will be entitled to the above reward, or to twenty dollars, for giving me information where I may get my woman.<BR>WILLIAM McWILLIE.<BR>Camden, Jan. 27, 1826. 5t73r
