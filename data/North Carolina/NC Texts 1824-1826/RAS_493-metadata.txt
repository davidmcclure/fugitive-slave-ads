Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the subscriber on the 9th January last, a negro man by the name of NED, about 40 years of age, dark complection[sic], about 5 feet 7 inches high, spare built, rather inclined to be gray haired, has a down look, speaks quick and lively. He is a very canning[sic] and artful chap, and a Cooper by trade. I think it is probable, if he has left this neighborhood, that he will attempt to pass for a free person, and no doubt will alter his name. I have every reason, though, to believe that he is lurking in this or some of the adjoining counties and is harbored by some rascals, whose names I forbear to mention.<BR>SETH SPEIGHT, sr.[Senior]<BR>Greene county, March 2, 1826. 11 6w
