Transcript: 50 Dollars Reward<BR>WILL be given for the apprehending and securing in Jail, so that I get him again, my Negro Man AUSTIN, who sometimes calls himself Austin Williams.  He is a tolerable bright mulatto, thirty-three years old, five feet eleven and three quarter inches high rather slender built, has lost the first joint of his right thumb, has a scar on his right wrist, occasioned by a burn: he reads and writes very well, and will no doubt forge himself a free Pass.  I purchased him of Joel Harris, of Halifax county, N.C. about 14 months since, who sold him on account of his taking up with a white woman, named Sally Doile, and with whom he attempted to run off, but was pursued and separated from this said Sally Doile, and got as far as Fluvanna, Va. before he was apprehended. Austin is a tolerable good Carpenter and Shoe-maker; he is perhaps one of the shrewdest negroes I ever saw, and will no doubt invent many plausible tales to prevent his being apprehended. He left home on Sunday night last, and took with him a Blood Bay Horse, with bob tail, 6 years old, a little galled by the collar, recently shod all round, and about 4 feet 11 inches high--Also a Saddle, Bridle and Martingale; the saddle is but little worn, and has a buff saddle-cloth.<BR>I will pay a reasonable reward, in addition to the above, for the Horse, Saddle & Bridle, upon being delivered to me.<BR>PETER EPES.<BR>Warren county, N.C. April 24.    55eo4t
