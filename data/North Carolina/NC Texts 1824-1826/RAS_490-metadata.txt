Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from Jonathan T. Eason some time in the month of February, 1825, a negro maned LYN. He is a stout well made negro, not very black, about six feet high. It is supposed that he passes for a free man. There is a scar on one of his knees, cut with an axe. The above reward will be given to any person that will apprehend the negro, and deliver him to me, living six miles south of Stantonsburg, or confine him in any jail, so that I can get him.<BR>ARTHUR SPEIGHT.<BR>March 4, 1826.<BR>11-10w
