Transcript: Ten Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN away from the subscriber, on the night of the 25th December, a negro fellow, named Stephen. He is about 31 years of age, about 5 feet 10 inches high. He had on, when he went off, a striped pair of pantaloons mixed coat long tail, and carried away with him bombazette pantaloons, black napped fur hat, short sailor coat, filled with yellow yarn. He has large whiskers and has a scar on his left cheek from the whisker to his nose and on the end of his nose, which is quite visible. I will give the above reward to any person that will deliver him to me, and all reasonable expenses paid; or confined in any Jail in this State, so that I get him again. It is likely he will aim for Hertford county, where he was raised. He formerly belonged to George Sessums.<BR>JOHN P. ALMON.<BR>Mountain Creek, N.C.}<BR>January 6, 1826}<BR>4-3t
