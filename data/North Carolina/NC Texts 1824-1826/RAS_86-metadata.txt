Transcript: RAN AWAY<BR> FROM the subscriber, about the 1st of August last, a negro fellow named Silas, aged about 24 years, is about 5 feet 9 inches high, tolerable black complexion, and stout built.--He ran away from the Thomas M'Ewen, from whom I bought him, and paid $500 for him. It is expected he is lurking about the neighborhood of Mr. Geo.[George] Hartman, dec'd.[deceased] or between there and John Black's, on M'Caubin's creek. A reasonable reward will be given to any person who will either deliver the said negro to me, in Cabarrus county, N.C. or secure him in any jail in the state, so that I may get him again. <BR> THOMPSON HUNT.<BR> Jan. 19. 1825.  2wt43
