Transcript: 25 Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, about two weeks since, a negro man named ABRAM, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches high, black complexion, and a little knockkneed.--He formerly belonged to Lemuel L. Hatch; professes to be religious, and sometimes exhorts. Some days ago, he had permission to seek a master, and I gave him a pass to that effect, which he has never returned, and probably still uses.<BR>This is therefore to infom[sic] all persons, that said pass is annulled; and to caution them against harbouring, employing, or carrying away said Negro, under the penalty of the law.  The above reward will be given to any person who will secure him in the Newbern jail.<BR>WILLIAM MITCHELL.<BR>November 12, 1824.--'49tf
