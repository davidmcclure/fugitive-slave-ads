Transcript: Fifteen Dollars Reward.<BR>RAN AWAY from the Subscriber, on the 12th inst. a Negro man named LEWIS.  He is about 25 years of age, five feet four or five inches high, yellow complexion, has a scar on one side of his face, speaks very quick, and is an impudent fellow. He formerly belonged to the late Richard Witherington, of Lenoir County, and is probably now lurking in that quarter, or in some of the neighbouring seaports towns.  Masters of vessels, and all othes are cautioned against harboring or carrying him away, under the penalty of the law.  The above reward, and all reasonable expenses, will be paid to any person who will confine said Negro in jail so that I get him again.<BR>SHADRACK LOFTIN.<BR>Kinston, Lenoir County, Dec. 24, 1825.
