Transcript: Fifty Dollars Reward.<BR>RANAWAY from the Subscriber, on the 1st day of January, 1825, a Negro Man named ISAAC, aged 27 years, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, complection somewhat yellow, broad shoulders and long straight nose.  I have been told that he exhibited a forged free pass, and a recommendation, with the aid of which he will no doubt endeavor to pass for a free man.  He was seen in Fayetteville last Spring, and said he was on his way to Wilmington, where he may yet be.  The above reward will be given for his delivery to me, and all reasonable expenses paid, or for his confinement in any Jail, so that I get him again.<BR>WILLIAM RIDGE.<BR>Randolph county, N.C. Feb.[February] 28, 1826--56-3t
